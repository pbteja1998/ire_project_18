<S ID='S-0' AZ='BKG'> The analysis of temporal expressions in natural language discourse provides a challenge for contemporary semantic theories . </S>
<S ID='S-1' AZ='OTH'> <REF TYPE='A'>Partee 1973</REF> introduced the notion of temporal anaphora , to account for ways in which temporal expressions depend on surrounding elements in the discourse for their semantic contribution to the discourse . </S>
<S ID='S-2' AZ='AIM'> In this paper , we discuss the interaction of temporal anaphora and quantification over eventualities . </S>
<S ID='S-3' AZ='OWN'> Such interaction , while interesting in its own right , is also a good test-bed for theories of the semantic interpretation of temporal expressions . </S>

<S ID='S-5' ABSTRACTC='A-1' AZ='CTR'> The analysis of sentences such as <CREF/> in <REF TYPE='A'>de Swart 1991</REF> , within the framework of Discourse Representation Theory ( DRT ) <REF TYPE='P'>Kamp 1981</REF> gives the wrong truth-conditions , when the temporal connective in the sentence is before or after . </S>
<S ID='S-6' AZ='CTR'> In DRT , such sentences trigger box-splitting with the eventuality of the subordinate clause and an updated reference time in the antecedent box , and the eventuality of the main clause in the consequent box , causing undesirable universal quantification over the reference time . </S>

<S ID='S-7' AZ='OTH'> This problem is analyzed in <REF TYPE='A'>de Swart 1991</REF> as an instance of the proportion problem and given a solution from a Generalized Quantifier approach . </S>
<S ID='S-8' AZ='OWN'> We were led to seek a solution for this problem within DRT , because of DRT 's advantages as a general theory of discourse , and its choice as the underlying formalism in another research project of ours , which deals with sentences such as <CREF/> - <CREF/> , in the context of natural language specifications of computerized systems . </S>
<S ID='S-9' AZ='BAS'> In this paper , we propose such a solution , based on a careful distinction between different roles of <REF TYPE='A'>Reichenbach 1947</REF> 's reference time , adapted from <REF TYPE='A'>Kamp and Reyle 1993</REF> . </S>

<HEADER ID='H-1'> Background </HEADER>
<P>
<S ID='S-11' AZ='BKG'> An analysis of the mechanism of temporal anaphoric reference hinges upon an understanding of the ontological and logical foundations of temporal reference . </S>
<S ID='S-12' AZ='OTH'> Different concepts have been used in the literature as primitives . </S>
<S ID='S-13' AZ='OTH'> These range from temporal instants in Tense logic <REF TYPE='P'>Prior 1967</REF> , through intervals of time <REF TYPE='P'>Bennet and Partee 1978(1972)</REF> as in the analysis of temporal connectives in <REF TYPE='A'>Heinmki 1978</REF> , to event structures <REF TYPE='P'>Kamp 1979</REF> as in <REF TYPE='A'>Hinrichs 1986</REF> 's analysis of temporal anaphora . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-14' AZ='BKG'> An important factor in the interpretation of temporal expressions is the classification of situations into different aspectual classes ( or Aktionsarten ) , which is based on distributional and semantic properties . </S>
<S ID='S-15' AZ='AIM'> In this paper , we only consider events and states , together termed eventualities in <REF TYPE='A'>Bach 1981</REF> . </S>
<S ID='S-16' AZ='BKG'> In narrative sequences , event clauses seem to advance the narrative time , while states block its progression . </S>
<S ID='S-17' AZ='OTH'> The mechanism used to account for this phenomena in <REF TYPE='A'>Hinrichs 1986</REF> and <REF TYPE='A'>Partee 1984</REF> , is based on the notion of reference time , originally proposed by <REF TYPE='A'>Reichenbach 1947</REF> . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-18' AZ='OTH'> <REFAUTHOR>Reichenbach</REFAUTHOR> 's well - known account of the interpretation of the different tense forms uses the temporal relations between three temporal indices : the utterance time , event time and reference time . </S>
<S ID='S-19' AZ='OTH'> The reference time according to <REF TYPE='A'>Reichenbach 1947</REF> is determined either by context , or by temporal adverbials . </S>
</P>
<DIV DEPTH='2'>
<HEADER ID='H-2'> A unified analysis of temporal anaphora </HEADER>
<P>
<S ID='S-20' AZ='OTH'> <REFAUTHOR>Hinrichs</REFAUTHOR> 's and <REFAUTHOR>Partee</REFAUTHOR> 's use of a notion of reference time , provides for a unified treatment of temporal anaphoric relations in discourse , which include narrative progression especially in sequences of simple past tense sentences , temporal adverbs and temporal adverbial clauses , introduced by a temporal connective . </S>
<S ID='S-21' AZ='OTH'> This concept of reference time is no longer an instant of time , but rather , an interval . </S>
<S ID='S-22' AZ='OTH'> This approach can be summarized as follows : in the processing of a discourse , the discourse-initial sentence is argued to require some contextually determined reference time . </S>
<S ID='S-23' AZ='OTH'> Further event clauses in the discourse introduce a new event , which is included within the then-current reference time . </S>
<S ID='S-24' AZ='OTH'> Each such event also causes the reference time to be updated to a time ` just after ' <REF TYPE='P'>Partee 1984</REF> this event . </S>
<S ID='S-25' AZ='OTH'> State clauses introduce new states , which include the current reference time , and do not update it . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-26' AZ='OTH'> As an example of such an analysis consider the following narrative discourse <REF TYPE='P'>Partee 1984</REF> . </S>
</P>
<EXAMPLE ID='E-1'>
<EX-S> John got up , went to the window , and raised the blind . </EX-S>
<EX-S> It was light out . </EX-S>
<EX-S> He pulled the blind down and went back to bed . </EX-S>
<EX-S> He wasn't ready to face the day . </EX-S>
<EX-S> He was too depressed . </EX-S>
</EXAMPLE>
<P>
<S ID='S-27' AZ='OTH'> Figure <CREF/> shows a DRS for the first two sentences of this discourse , according to <REFAUTHOR>Hinrichs</REFAUTHOR> 's and <REFAUTHOR>Partee</REFAUTHOR> 's analysis . </S>
<S ID='S-28' AZ='OTH'> The ` n ' in the top DRS is a mnemonic for ` now ' - the utterance time . </S>
<S ID='S-29' AZ='OTH'> The first event in the discourse , <EQN/> - John 's getting up - is interpreted relative to a contextually understood reference time , <EQN/> . </S>
<S ID='S-30' AZ='OTH'> The event <EQN/> is included in the current reference time , <EQN/> . </S>
<S ID='S-31' AZ='OTH'> A new reference time marker , <EQN/> is then introduced . </S>
<S ID='S-32' AZ='OTH'> <EQN/> lies immediately after <EQN/> ( recorded as <EQN/> ) . </S>
<S ID='S-33' AZ='OTH'> <EQN/> serves as the current reference time for the following event <EQN/> . </S>
<S ID='S-34' AZ='OTH'> We continue in this fashion , updating the reference time , until the second sentence in the discourse is processed . </S>
<S ID='S-35' AZ='OTH'> This sentence denotes a state , <EQN/> , which includes the then-current reference time . </S>
</P>
<IMAGE ID='I-1'/>
<P>
<S ID='S-36' AZ='OTH'> Adverbial phrases , whether phrasal ( e.g. ` On Sunday ' ) or clausal ( e.g. ` When Bill left ' ) , are processed before the main clause . </S>
<S ID='S-37' AZ='OTH'> They introduce a reference time , which overrides the current reference time , and provides an anaphoric antecedent for the tense in the main clause . </S>
<S ID='S-38' AZ='OTH'> This mechanism is used to explain how tense and temporal adverbials can combine to temporally locate the occurrence , without running into problems of relative scope <REF TYPE='P'>Hinrichs 1988</REF> . </S>
<S ID='S-39' AZ='OTH'> The tense morpheme of the main clause locates the event time with respect to the reference time , whereas temporal adverbials are used to locate the reference time . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-40' AZ='OTH'> When-clauses , for example , introduce a new reference time , which is ordered after the events described in the preceding discourse . </S>
<S ID='S-41' AZ='OTH'> The eventuality in the when-clause is related to this reference time as discussed earlier with respect to narrative progression : a state includes its reference time , while an event is included in it . </S>
<S ID='S-42' AZ='OTH'> The eventuality in the main clause is interpreted with respect to this reference time . </S>
<S ID='S-43' AZ='OTH'> If the main clause is an event-clause , this event introduces a new reference time , just after the event time of the main clause . </S>
<S ID='S-44' AZ='OTH'> As an example , consider the following discourse <REF TYPE='P'>Partee 1984</REF> . </S>

<EXAMPLE ID='E-2'>
<EX-S> Mary turned the corner . </EX-S>
<EX-S> When John saw her , she crossed the street . </EX-S>
<EX-S> She hurried into a store . </EX-S>

<P>
<S ID='S-46' AZ='OTH'> <REF TYPE='A'>Partee 1984</REF> extends <REFAUTHOR>Hinrichs</REFAUTHOR> 's treatment of temporal anaphora to the analysis of sentences , which contain a temporal adverbial and quantification over eventualities . </S>
<S ID='S-47' AZ='OTH'> According to her analysis , these trigger box-splitting as do if or every clauses in DRT <REF TYPE='P'>Kamp 1981</REF> . </S>
<S ID='S-48' AZ='OTH'> Consider the following example from <REF TYPE='A'>Partee 1984</REF> . </S>

<EX-S> Whenever Mary telephoned , Sam was asleep . </EX-S>
</EXAMPLE>
<IMAGE ID='I-3'/>
<P>
<S ID='S-49' AZ='OTH'> The subordinate clause cannot be interpreted relative to a single reference time , since Mary 's telephoning is not specified to occur at some specific time . </S>
<S ID='S-50' AZ='OTH'> Still , the sentence needs to be interpreted relative to a reference time . </S>
<S ID='S-51' AZ='OTH'> This reference time can be a large interval , and should contain each of the relevant occurrences of Mary 's telephoning during which Bill was asleep . </S>
<S ID='S-52' AZ='OTH'> This reference time is represented as <EQN/> in the top sub-DRS . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-53' AZ='OTH'> The ` whenever ' triggers box-splitting . </S>
<S ID='S-54' AZ='OTH'> The event marker - <EQN/> is introduced in the antecedent box , with the condition that it be temporally included in the current reference time , <EQN/> and be prior to n . </S>
<S ID='S-55' AZ='OTH'> The ` whenever ' also causes the introduction of <EQN/> , a new reference time marker . </S>
<S ID='S-56' AZ='OTH'> <EQN/> lies ` just after ' <EQN/> . </S>
<S ID='S-57' AZ='OTH'> The stative clause causes the introduction of <EQN/> , which includes the reference time <EQN/> . </S>
</P>

<S ID='S-58' AZ='OTH'> The embedding conditions for the whole construction are just like those for a regular ` if ' or ` every ' clause , i.e. the sentence is true , if every proper embedding of the antecedent box can be extended to a proper embedding of the combination of the antecedent and the consequent boxes . </S>
<S ID='S-59' AZ='OTH'> This means , as desired , that for each choice of an event <EQN/> of Mary 's telephoning , and reference time <EQN/> ` just after ' it , there is a state of Sam 's being asleep , that surrounds <EQN/> . </S>

<P>
<S ID='S-60' AZ='OTH'> A sentence such as <CREF/> which is the same as sentence <CREF/> , except the ` whenever ' is replaced by ` when ' , and ` always ' is added in the main clause , would get the same DRS . </S>

<HEADER ID='H-4'> Extending the analysis </HEADER>
<P>
<S ID='S-61' AZ='CTR'> As noted in <REF TYPE='A'>Partee 1984</REF> , this analysis does not extend in a straightforward manner to cases in which the operator when is replaced by ( an unrestricted ) before or after , in such quantified contexts . </S>
<S ID='S-62' AZ='CTR'> Constructing a similar DRS for such sentences gives the wrong truth conditions . </S>
<S ID='S-63' AZ='OTH'> For example , Figure <CREF/> a shows a DRS for sentence <CREF/> , according to the principles above . </S>
<S ID='S-64' AZ='OTH'> <EQN/> - the reference time , used for the interpretation of the main clause is placed in the universe of the antecedent box . </S>
<S ID='S-65' AZ='OTH'> Because the temporal connective is ` before ' , <EQN/> is restricted to lie before <EQN/> . </S>
<S ID='S-66' AZ='OTH'> The embedding conditions determine , that this reference time be universally quantified over , causing an erroneous reading in which for each event , <EQN/> , of John 's calling , for each earlier time <EQN/> , he lights up a cigarette . </S>
<S ID='S-67' AZ='CTR'> Paraphrasing this , we could say that John lights up cigarettes at all times preceding each phone call , not just once preceding each phone call . </S>
<S ID='S-68' AZ='OTH'> We did not encounter this problem in the DRS in Figure <CREF/> , since although the reference time <EQN/> , is universally quantified over in that DRS as well , it is also restricted , to immediately follow <EQN/> . </S>
<S ID='S-69' AZ='OTH'> It is similarly restricted if ` before ' is replaced with ` just before ' or ` ten minutes before ' . </S>
<S ID='S-70' AZ='OTH'> But , ( unrestricted ) ` before ' is analyzed as ` some time before ' , and thus the problem arises . </S>
<S ID='S-71' AZ='OWN'> We will henceforth informally refer to this problem as <REFAUTHOR>Partee</REFAUTHOR> 's quantification problem . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-72' AZ='OTH'> <REF TYPE='A'>Partee 1984</REF> suggests that in these cases we somehow have to insure that the reference time , <EQN/> , appears in the universe of the consequent DRS , causing it to be existentially quantified over , giving the desired interpretation . </S>
<S ID='S-73' AZ='CTR'> <REF TYPE='A'>de Swart 1991</REF> notes that simply moving <EQN/> to the right-hand box does not agree with <REFAUTHOR>Hinrichs</REFAUTHOR> 's assumption , that temporal clauses are processed before the main clause , since they update the reference time , with respect to which the main clause will be interpreted . </S>
<S ID='S-74' AZ='OWN'> In our proposed solution , the ` reference time ' is indeed moved to the right box , but it is a different notion of reference time , and ( as will be shown ) exempt from this criticism . </S>

<S ID='S-89' AZ='BAS'> Following <REF TYPE='A'>Kamp and Reyle 1993</REF> , we split the role of the reference time , used to account for a large array of phenomena , into several independent mechanisms . </S>

<S ID='S-95' AZ='OWN'> The verb tense determines the relation between the location time and the utterance time e.g. if the tense is simple past , the location time lies anteriorly to the utterance time . </S>
<S ID='S-96' AZ='OWN'> When it is simple present , the location time coincides with the utterance time . </S>

<S ID='S-124' AZ='OWN'> The assymetry in using the event time for e and the location time for e ' arises from the interpretation rules of temporal connectives ( for both quantified and non-quantified sentences ) . </S>

<S ID='S-132' AZ='TXT'> In this section we present some applications of our analysis to related constructions . </S>
<S ID='S-133' AZ='OWN'> First , we consider the past perfect , as in sentence <CREF/> . </S>
<S ID='S-134' AZ='OTH'> <REF TYPE='A'>de Swart 1991</REF> gives this example to illustrate the inability to interpret temporal connectives without the use of the reference times . </S>
<S ID='S-135' AZ='OTH'> According to <REF TYPE='A'>de Swart 1991</REF> , the subordinate clause determines the reference time of the verb , which lies anteriorly to the event time . </S>
<S ID='S-136' AZ='OWN'> Trying to use the event times would give the wrong analysis . </S>
<S ID='S-137' AZ='OWN'> This would seem to be troublesome for our approach , which uses the location time of the event in the main clause , and not its reference time . </S>
<S ID='S-138' AZ='OWN'> However , this is not a problem , since our analysis of the perfect by the use of the operator perf , analyses the eventuality referred to by the main clause , as the result state of a previous event . </S>
<S ID='S-139' AZ='OWN'> The temporal relation in the sentence is inclusion between the event time of Anne 's coming home , and the location time of the result state of Paul 's already having prepared dinner . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-140' AZ='OWN'> Next , we consider narrative progression in quantified contexts , as in sentence <CREF/> . </S>
<S ID='S-141' AZ='OWN'> The basic construction is just the same as in the paradigm structure , but now we have narrative progression in the consequent box . </S>
<S ID='S-142' AZ='OWN'> This narrative progression is handled as ordinary narrative progression in <REF TYPE='A'>Kamp and Reyle 1993</REF> , i.e. by resetting the Rpt . </S>
<S ID='S-143' AZ='OWN'> The DRS in Figure <CREF/> describes the complex state <EQN/> , that after each event of John 's coming home , there is a sequence of subsequent events according to his activities . </S>
</P>
<IMAGE ID='I-7'/>
<P>
<S ID='S-144' AZ='OWN'> Finally , we deal with sentences such as <CREF/> , which contain an iteration of an implicit generic quantifier and always . </S>
<S ID='S-145' AZ='OWN'> The situation described by John 's always squinting when the sun is shining is analyzed as a complex state <EQN/> . </S>
<S ID='S-146' AZ='OWN'> This state holds whenever John is at the beach , recorded by the condition that the location time <EQN/> of <EQN/> overlaps the event time , <EQN/> of John 's being at the beach , <EQN/> in Figure <CREF/> . </S>
