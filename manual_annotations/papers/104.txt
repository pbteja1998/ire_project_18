There has been considerable controversy regarding how to name and
define the illnesses known as myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) and chronic
fatigue syndrome (CFS). The IOM report has proposed a new clinical criteria
and name for this illness, but aspects of these recommendations have been
scrutinized by patients and scientists.

It is possible that both empiric and consensus approaches could be
used to help settle some of these diagnostic challenges. Using patient
samples collected in the United States, Great Britain, and Norway
(N=556), the current study attempted to categorize patients using
more general as well as more restricted case definitions.

Overall, the outcomes suggest that there might be four groupings of
patients, with the broadest category involving those with chronic fatigue
(N=62), defined by 6 or more months of fatigue which can be cannot
be explained by medical or psychiatric conditions. A second category
involves those patients that have chronic fatigue that can be explained by a
medical or psychiatric condition (N=47). A third category involves
more specific criteria that have been posited both by the IOM report, a
Canadian Clinical Case criteria, a ME-ICC criteria and a more empiric
approach. These efforts have specified domains of substantial reductions of
activity, post-exertional malaise, neurocognitive impairment, and sleep
dysfunction (N=346). Patients with these characteristics were more
functionally impaired than those meeting just chronic fatigue criteria,
p < .05. Finally, those meeting even more
restrictive ME criteria proposed by Ramsay, identified a smaller and even
more impaired group, p < .05.

The advantages of using such empirical and consensus approaches to
develop reliable classification and diagnostic efforts are discussed.

Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) has been defined by 20 case definitions, and the
large number of case definitions provide both researchers and clinicians challenges in
both diagnosing and treating patients. [1] The Fukuda et al. [2] case definition of CFS has been the most frequently used, and
epidemiologic studies can provide clues for approaches to categorize patients. According
to one community-based epidemiologic study by Jason et al. [3], about 4% of the population experience 6
or more months of fatigue. Within this group, 19% meet Fukuda et al. criteria,
27% do not meet these Fukuda et al. criteria, and 54% of this group have
a medical or psychiatric (melancholic depression, bipolar disorders, anorexia nervosa or
bulimia nervosa, psychotic disorders, drug or alcohol related disorders) exclusionary
illness.

Unfortunately, the Fukuda et al. [2] criteria have been assessed with different instruments and
operationalized differently. As a result, the rates of CFS prevalence in community-based
samples have ranged widely, from .004 to .0087%, .24%, and .42%
to 2.54% of the population. [3–6] For example,
Reeves et al. [7] attempted to
operationalize the Fukuda et al. [2] criteria, but this effort resulted in broadening of the case
definition. [8] In addition, the
polythetic criteria of Fukuda et al. [2] have been criticized as not requiring fundamental symptoms including
post-exertional malaise. [9] As a
reaction to these criticisms, the Clinical Canadian ME/CFS criteria [10] developed by a group of researchers and
clinicians, which required seven symptoms including post-exertional malaise and
neurocognitive impairment. Later, the Myalgic Encephalomyelitis International Consensus
criteria (ME-ICC) [11] were
developed and they required eight symptoms.

The history of this illness began with an outbreak of epidemic neuromysthenia in
L.A. County [12–13] In a 1956 editorial in the
Lancet, the term “benign myalgic encephalomyelitis”
was coined. [14] Later, Ramsay
[15] published a definition
of this illness using the term “myalgic encephalomyelitis” (ME) and the
term “benign” was dropped due to the seriousness of the disability.
[16] There were later efforts
to operationalize Ramsay’s [15] ME case definition with what are now known as the London criteria.
[17–19]

In one community-based study, these London ME criteria were found to select a
smaller and more symptomatic group of patients than the CFS Fukuda et al [2] criteria. [20] In an effort to better operationalize these ME
criteria based on the work of a number of theorists and practitioners, Jason,
Damrongvachiraphan, et al. [21]
used more precise frequency and severity criteria of symptoms for post-exertional
malaise, neurological manifestation, and autonomic dysfunction. Patients also needed to
have an acute onset to meet this ME criteria. When Jason, Brown et al. [22] applied these revised ME criteria to a
data set of patients in a tertiary sample diagnosed with CFS using the Fukuda et al.
[2] criteria, only 24%
met these ME criteria, and they were more functionally impaired than those that just met
the Fukuda et al. criteria. Later, Jason, Evans, Brown, Sunnquist, and Newton
[23] found that 29.6%
of a CFS sample in the US, and 17.7% of a CFS sample in England met these ME
criteria. The more restrictive ME criteria appear to select a smaller group of patients
than the Fukuda et al. [2]
criteria, and those selected with ME are more impaired.

The Canadian Clinical ME/CFS Criteria [10] in contrast to the Fukuda et al. [2] criteria has been found to select cases with less
psychiatric comorbidity, more physical functioning impairment, more fatigue or weakness,
and more neuropsychiatric and neurological symptoms [24], and comparable findings emerged in another study
by Jason, Brown, et al. [25].
When Jason, Brown, Evans, Sunnquist, and Newton [26] utilized three different samples of patients, each collected
through a different case ascertainment method, 87 to 96% of the samples met the
Fukuda et al. [2] case definition
criteria, whereas only 73 to 77% met the Canadian ME/CFS criteria.
Unfortunately, a study by Johnston, Brenu, Staines, and Marshall-Gradisnik’s
[27] found that only one
study reported prevalence rates according to these Canadian Consensus criteria.

The more recently developed ME-ICC criteria [11] also identified a group of patients with more
functional impairments and physical, mental, and cognitive problems than the larger
group of patients who met the Fukuda et al. criteria. [28] In a larger study with samples from the US and
Great Britain, Jason, Sunnquist, Brown, Evans, and Newton [29] found from 57 to 58% met the ME-ICC case
definition, whereas the Fukuda et al. criteria identified a larger group of patients.
Johnston, Brenu, Hardcastle, Huth, Staines, and Marshall-Gradisnik [30] also found that patients fulfilling the
ME-ICC criteria reported significantly lower scores for physical functioning, role
physical, bodily pain, social functioning as well as greater disability than those who
met the Fukuda et al. [2]
criteria.

These different definitions and criteria provide substantial problems for
investigators, because if case definitions have different symptoms, which are measured
in different ways, then criterion variance is introduced. If diagnostic categories are
unreliable, then this will have problematic consequences for estimating prevalence rates
or finding biological markers. Empirical approaches might help specify which symptoms
and domains have both the needed sensitivity and specificity for the case definitions.
More empirical methods have been used to identify symptoms that differentiate CFS
samples from controls. [31–32] For example, Jason, Kot, et al.
[33] used data mining
techniques to separate patients with CFS from controls. Outcomes from these analyses
suggest that individuals identified using fewer, but empirically selected, symptoms
(i.e., fatigue or extreme tiredness, physically drained/sick after mild activity,
difficulty finding the right word to say or expressing thoughts, and unrefreshing sleep)
could accurately identify patients and controls. Hawk, Jason and Torres-Harding
[34] also found these domains
were able to successfully differentiate patients with CFS from Major Depressive
Disorder. Although a moderate percentage of the CFS group reports other important
symptoms within pain, autonomic, immune, and neuroendocrine domains, they are less
prominent.

Using factor analytic approaches, Brown and Jason [35] found a three-factor solution: Neuroendocrine,
Autonomic, and Immune Dysfunction; Neurological/Cognitive Dysfunction; and
Post-Exertional Malaise. In a more recent study with a large data set of 788 patients,
Jason, Sunnquist et al. [36]
found a 4-factor solution. Three of these factors, cognitive dysfunction,
post-exertional malaise, and sleep, fit well with previous literature indicating that
these are cardinal symptom clusters. A combined factor involving neuroendocrine,
autonomic and immune dysfunction symptoms suggests that neuroendocrine, autonomic, and
immune areas that occur at lower rates than the more core domains might be better
thought of as subtypes of the illness. These investigators next used an exploratory
factor analysis to examine solely the items within this heterogeneous factor. The
results indicate that circulatory/neuroendocrine impairment, orthostatic intolerance,
and gastro-intestinal distress could be thought of as subtypes.

A new name for CFS and a new clinical criteria has recently been proposed by the
Institute of Medicine [37] in the
US. The new name is Systemic Exertion Intolerance Disease (SEID), and the new clinical
criteria requires the following four symptoms: substantial reduction or impairment in
the ability to engage in pre-illness levels of occupational, educational, social, or
personal activities; post-exertional malaise; unrefreshing sleep; and at least one of
the two following symptoms: cognitive impairment or orthostatic intolerance. SEID is
clinical criteria and was designed for clinicians who may require less rigor in their
diagnostic assessment of patients with CFS. Jason, Sunnquist, and Brown et al.
[38] analyzed archival
samples from tertiary care settings which included seven hundred and ninety-six patients
from the USA, Great Britain, and Norway. If investigators begin to compare and contrast
the SEID criteria with other existing criteria, it would be of some importance for the
scientific community to be informed of the consequences. For example, our findings
indicated that the SEID criteria identified 88% of participants in the samples
analyzed, which was comparable to the 92% that met the Fukuda criteria. However,
the samples selected had already been screened for exclusionary illnesses. Because the
SEID criteria have few exclusionary conditions, when other data sets were examined that
had other illness groups, a study by Jason, Sunnquist et al. [39] found that the SEID prevalence rate would be 2.8
times as great as the rate found when the Fukuda et al. [2] criteria were applied. In addition, the erroneous
inclusion of individuals with primary psychiatric conditions in SEID samples would have
detrimental consequences for the interpretation of epidemiologic, etiologic, and
treatment efficacy findings for people with this illness. For example, 47% of a
sample of individuals with melancholic depression met SEID criteria. It should be noted
that these studies were not prospective, and the SEID criteria were not directly
assessed in these patients; instead, symptoms meant to represent the criteria were
examined in a cohort that was diagnosed using different diagnostic criteria.

In the large sample described by Jason, Sunnquist et al. [39], the four-item empiric criteria
[40] identified only
61% of patients whereas ME criteria identified even fewer at 20%. It
appears that the Fukuda et al. [2]
criteria includes more patients, with fewer being identified with the Canadian
ME/CFS[10], ME-ICC criteria
[11], or empiric criteria
[40], with still fewer
meeting the London ME criteria described by Jason, Damrongvachiraphan, et al.
[21].

The present study classified patients into four groupings of patients. The
exclusionary condition is composed of patients that have chronic fatigue which can be
explained by a medical or psychiatric factor. At the Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Advisory
Committee (CFSAC) in August of 2015, a recommendation was voted on and approved
regarding treating exclusionary illnesses as has occurred with other case definitions,
which is a departure from the IOM report. [2, 10, 37] A second grouping is chronic fatigue, which
involves 6 or more months of fatigue which cannot be explained by a medical or
psychiatric factor. A third category involves more specific criteria that have been
posited both by the IOM report, a Canadian Clinical Case criteria, a ME-ICC criteria and
a more empiric approach [10–11, 40] specifying domains of post-exertional malaise, neurocognitive
impairment, and sleep dysfunction, as well as substantial reductions in activity; we
hypothesized that this group was more functionally impaired than those meeting just
chronic fatigue criteria. Finally, those meeting more restrictive ME criteria proposed
by Ramsay [15] and the London
criteria [17] were hypothesized
to identify a smaller more impaired group.
Research Participants



An international convenience sample of adults self-identifying as
having CFS, ME/CFS, or ME was recruited. To be eligible, an individual
needed to be at least 18, capable of reading and writing English, and have a
self-reported, current diagnosis of ME, CFS, or ME/CFS. Following approval
from DePaul University’s Institutional Review Board, participants
were recruited from a variety of sources: postings on internet forums,
support group visits, re-contacting individuals who had participated in the
DePaul research team’s studies in the past, and contacting
individuals who had emailed the team in the past with interest in future
studies.

Participants were given three options for completing study measures:
an electronic survey, a hard-copy survey, or a verbal survey over the
telephone. All participants were given the opportunity to complete these
surveys at home or in person at DePaul University. Participants were not
given a timeline for survey completion, as this illness can be unpredictable
and result in a rapid decline of functioning on any given day. The first one
hundred individuals who completed the survey received a $5.00 gift
card to Amazon.com for their participation. Of the 217 individuals who
participated, 216 were included in the present study; one participant was
excluded due to incomplete data.

Demographically, the sample was 84.2% female and
15.8% male. This sample was predominantly (97.7%) Caucasian,
while 0.5% identified as Asian, and the remaining 1.9%
selected ‘Other’ as their race. Only 13.5% of the
sample was working full- or part-time, and 56.7% of the sample was
on disability. With regard to educational level, 40.5% of the sample
held a graduate or professional degree; 34.4% held a standard
college degree; 18.1% had attended college for at least one year;
and 7.0% completed high school or had a GED. The mean age of the
sample was 52.0 (SD = 11.3).



Participants in the Newcastle sample had been referred for a medical
assessment at the Newcastle-upon-Tyne Royal Victoria Infirmary clinic due to
a suspected diagnosis of CFS. An experienced physician performed a
comprehensive medical history and examination, and individuals who met
eligibility criteria completed a written informed consent process. A total
of one hundred participants completed study measures by hard copy, but three
were excluded due to incomplete data.

The Newcastle sample was 99.0% Caucasian and 1.0%
multiracial, and 82.5% of participants were female. Of this sample,
37.5% of participants were working either part- or full-time, and
30.2% were on disability. With regard to education level,
20.9% had a graduate or professional degree; 29.7% had a
college degree; 24.2% had completed at least one year of college;
14.3% had a high school degree; and 11.0% had not completed
high school. The average age of the sample was 45.6 (SD
= 14.0).



Individuals with CFS were invited to participate in a randomized
controlled trial of a CFS self-management program. Participants were
recruited from four mid-sized towns in southern Norway, two suburbs of Oslo,
and some surrounding communities. Recruitment sources included: healthcare
professionals, the waiting list for a patient education program, and CFS
patient organizations. Information about the study was disseminated through
brochures and personal communication. In addition, study announcements for
participants were placed on the Oslo University Hospital website.

Participants were required to be older than 18 years of age and
diagnosed with CFS by a physician or medical specialist. In addition,
participants could not be pregnant and needed to be physically able to
attend the self-management program. Those who were interested in
participation were given additional information by telephone. Participants
completed a consent form that provided permission to request confirmation of
their CFS diagnosis from their physician or medical specialist. The study
gained approval from the Regional Committee for Medical Research Ethics
(Health Region North) and the Privacy Ombudsman for Research at Oslo
University Hospital. Of the 176 participants, 175 were included in this
study; one participant was excluded due to missing data.

This sample was 86.8% female and 13.2% male. Almost
all participants were Caucasian (99.4%); one participant selected
‘Other’ when asked about race. Only 9.7% of
participants were working, while 84.0% were on disability. Regarding
education, 9.9% of participants had a graduate or professional
degree, 40.1% a standard college degree, 41.9% a high school
degree, and the remainder had not completed high school. The mean age of the
sample was 43.4 years (SD = 11.7).



Participants were recruited from an inpatient medical ward for
severely ill patients as well as from the outpatient clinic at a
multidisciplinary CFS/ME Center. To be eligible for inclusion, participants
needed to be between 18 and 65 years old and capable of reading and writing
Norwegian. Individuals with a suspected diagnosis of CFS were referred for
evaluation and completed the study measures. All participants took part in a
comprehensive medical history interview and a detailed medical examination
conducted by experienced consultant physicians and a psychologist. The
examinations were conducted to rule out exclusionary medical and psychiatric
conditions. Participants completed a written informed consent, and the study
measures were completed by hard copy. The project gained approval from the
Privacy Ombudsman for research at Oslo University Hospital. Of the 64 total
participants, 63 were included in this study; one was excluded due to
missing data.

This sample was 82.5% female and 17.5% male. The
majority of the sample identified as Caucasian, but 1.6% identified
as Asian, and 3.3% as ‘Other.’ Most participants
(76.2%) were on disability, while 19.0% were working. With
regard to education, 11.1% held a graduate or professional degree;
25.4% held a standard college degree; 46.0% had a high
school degree; and 17.5% had not completed high school. The mean age
of the sample was 34.9 years (SD = 11.6).

There has been considerable controversy regarding how to name and
define the illnesses known as myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) and chronic
fatigue syndrome (CFS). The IOM report has proposed a new clinical criteria
and name for this illness, but aspects of these recommendations have been
scrutinized by patients and scientists.

It is possible that both empiric and consensus approaches could be
used to help settle some of these diagnostic challenges. Using patient
samples collected in the United States, Great Britain, and Norway
(N=556), the current study attempted to categorize patients using
more general as well as more restricted case definitions.

Overall, the outcomes suggest that there might be four groupings of

more specific criteria that have been posited both by the IOM report, a
Canadian Clinical Case criteria, a ME-ICC criteria and a more empiric
approach. These efforts have specified domains of substantial reductions of
activity, post-exertional malaise, neurocognitive impairment, and sleep
dysfunction (N=346). Patients with these characteristics were more
functionally impaired than those meeting just chronic fatigue criteria,
p < .05. Finally, those meeting even more
restrictive ME criteria proposed by Ramsay, identified a smaller and even
more impaired group, p < .05.

The advantages of using such empirical and consensus approaches to
develop reliable classification and diagnostic efforts are discussed.

Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) has been defined by 20 case definitions, and the
large number of case definitions provide both researchers and clinicians challenges in
both diagnosing and treating patients. [1] The Fukuda et al. [2] case definition of CFS has been the most frequently used, and

27% do not meet these Fukuda et al. criteria, and 54% of this group have
a medical or psychiatric (melancholic depression, bipolar disorders, anorexia nervosa or

illness.

Unfortunately, the Fukuda et al. [2] criteria have been assessed with different instruments and

psychiatric comorbidity, more physical functioning impairment, more fatigue or weakness,
and more neuropsychiatric and neurological symptoms [24], and comparable findings emerged in another study
by Jason, Brown, et al. [25].
When Jason, Brown, Evans, Sunnquist, and Newton [26] utilized three different samples of patients, each collected
through a different case ascertainment method, 87 to 96% of the samples met the
Fukuda et al. [2] case definition
criteria, whereas only 73 to 77% met the Canadian ME/CFS criteria.
Unfortunately, a study by Johnston, Brenu, Staines, and Marshall-Gradisnik’s
[27] found that only one
study reported prevalence rates according to these Canadian Consensus criteria.

The more recently developed ME-ICC criteria [11] also identified a group of patients with more
functional impairments and physical, mental, and cognitive problems than the larger
group of patients who met the Fukuda et al. criteria. [28] In a larger study with samples from the US and
Great Britain, Jason, Sunnquist, Brown, Evans, and Newton [29] found from 57 to 58% met the ME-ICC case
definition, whereas the Fukuda et al. criteria identified a larger group of patients.
Johnston, Brenu, Hardcastle, Huth, Staines, and Marshall-Gradisnik [30] also found that patients fulfilling the
ME-ICC criteria reported significantly lower scores for physical functioning, role
physical, bodily pain, social functioning as well as greater disability than those who
met the Fukuda et al. [2]
criteria.

These different definitions and criteria provide substantial problems for
investigators, because if case definitions have different symptoms, which are measured
in different ways, then criterion variance is introduced. If diagnostic categories are
unreliable, then this will have problematic consequences for estimating prevalence rates
or finding biological markers. Empirical approaches might help specify which symptoms
and domains have both the needed sensitivity and specificity for the case definitions.
More empirical methods have been used to identify symptoms that differentiate CFS
samples from controls. [31–32] For example, Jason, Kot, et al.
[33] used data mining
techniques to separate patients with CFS from controls. Outcomes from these analyses
suggest that individuals identified using fewer, but empirically selected, symptoms
(i.e., fatigue or extreme tiredness, physically drained/sick after mild activity,
difficulty finding the right word to say or expressing thoughts, and unrefreshing sleep)
could accurately identify patients and controls. Hawk, Jason and Torres-Harding
[34] also found these domains
were able to successfully differentiate patients with CFS from Major Depressive
Disorder. Although a moderate percentage of the CFS group reports other important
symptoms within pain, autonomic, immune, and neuroendocrine domains, they are less
prominent.

Using factor analytic approaches, Brown and Jason [35] found a three-factor solution: Neuroendocrine,
Autonomic, and Immune Dysfunction; Neurological/Cognitive Dysfunction; and
Post-Exertional Malaise. In a more recent study with a large data set of 788 patients,
Jason, Sunnquist et al. [36]
found a 4-factor solution. Three of these factors, cognitive dysfunction,
post-exertional malaise, and sleep, fit well with previous literature indicating that
these are cardinal symptom clusters. A combined factor involving neuroendocrine,
autonomic and immune dysfunction symptoms suggests that neuroendocrine, autonomic, and
immune areas that occur at lower rates than the more core domains might be better
thought of as subtypes of the illness. These investigators next used an exploratory
factor analysis to examine solely the items within this heterogeneous factor. The
results indicate that circulatory/neuroendocrine impairment, orthostatic intolerance,
and gastro-intestinal distress could be thought of as subtypes.

A new name for CFS and a new clinical criteria has recently been proposed by the
Institute of Medicine [37] in the
US. The new name is Systemic Exertion Intolerance Disease (SEID), and the new clinical
criteria requires the following four symptoms: substantial reduction or impairment in
the ability to engage in pre-illness levels of occupational, educational, social, or
personal activities; post-exertional malaise; unrefreshing sleep; and at least one of
the two following symptoms: cognitive impairment or orthostatic intolerance. SEID is
clinical criteria and was designed for clinicians who may require less rigor in their
diagnostic assessment of patients with CFS. Jason, Sunnquist, and Brown et al.
[38] analyzed archival
samples from tertiary care settings which included seven hundred and ninety-six patients
from the USA, Great Britain, and Norway. If investigators begin to compare and contrast
the SEID criteria with other existing criteria, it would be of some importance for the
scientific community to be informed of the consequences. For example, our findings
indicated that the SEID criteria identified 88% of participants in the samples
analyzed, which was comparable to the 92% that met the Fukuda criteria. However,
the samples selected had already been screened for exclusionary illnesses. Because the
SEID criteria have few exclusionary conditions, when other data sets were examined that
had other illness groups, a study by Jason, Sunnquist et al. [39] found that the SEID prevalence rate would be 2.8
times as great as the rate found when the Fukuda et al. [2] criteria were applied. In addition, the erroneous
inclusion of individuals with primary psychiatric conditions in SEID samples would have
detrimental consequences for the interpretation of epidemiologic, etiologic, and
treatment efficacy findings for people with this illness. For example, 47% of a
sample of individuals with melancholic depression met SEID criteria. It should be noted
that these studies were not prospective, and the SEID criteria were not directly
assessed in these patients; instead, symptoms meant to represent the criteria were
examined in a cohort that was diagnosed using different diagnostic criteria.

In the large sample described by Jason, Sunnquist et al. [39], the four-item empiric criteria
[40] identified only
61% of patients whereas ME criteria identified even fewer at 20%. It
appears that the Fukuda et al. [2]
criteria includes more patients, with fewer being identified with the Canadian
ME/CFS[10], ME-ICC criteria
[11], or empiric criteria
[40], with still fewer
meeting the London ME criteria described by Jason, Damrongvachiraphan, et al.
[21].

The present study classified patients into four groupings of patients. The
exclusionary condition is composed of patients that have chronic fatigue which can be
explained by a medical or psychiatric factor. At the Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Advisory
Committee (CFSAC) in August of 2015, a recommendation was voted on and approved
regarding treating exclusionary illnesses as has occurred with other case definitions,
which is a departure from the IOM report. [2, 10, 37] A second grouping is chronic fatigue, which
involves 6 or more months of fatigue which cannot be explained by a medical or
psychiatric factor. A third category involves more specific criteria that have been
posited both by the IOM report, a Canadian Clinical Case criteria, a ME-ICC criteria and
a more empiric approach [10–11, 40] specifying domains of post-exertional malaise, neurocognitive
impairment, and sleep dysfunction, as well as substantial reductions in activity; we
hypothesized that this group was more functionally impaired than those meeting just
chronic fatigue criteria. Finally, those meeting more restrictive ME criteria proposed
by Ramsay [15] and the London
criteria [17] were hypothesized
to identify a smaller more impaired group.
The DePaul Symptom Questionnaire

All participants completed the DePaul Symptom Questionnaire (DSQ), a
self-report measure of ME and CFS symptomatology, demographics, and medical,
occupational and social history. [41] This measure was developed to classify individuals by a
variety of ME and CFS case definitions, but the list of 54 symptoms was based
upon a revised approach to the Clinical Canadian criteria. [10] Participants rate each
symptom’s frequency over the past six months on a 5-point Likert scale:
0=none of the time, 1=a little of the time, 2=about half
the time, 3=most of the time, and 4=all of the time. Likewise,
participants rate each symptom’s severity over the past six months on a
5-point Likert scale: 0=symptom not present, 1=mild,
2=moderate, 3=severe, 4=very severe. Frequency and
severity scores were multiplied by 25 to create 100-point scales. The 100-point
frequency and severity scores for each symptom were averaged to create one
composite score per symptom. The DSQ has evidenced good test-retest reliability
among both patient and control groups. [42] A factor analysis of these symptoms resulted in a
three-factor solution, and these factors evidenced good internal consistency.
[35] The DSQ is
available in the shared library of Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap)
[43], hosted at
DePaul University: https://redcap.is.depaul.edu/surveys/?s=tRxytSPVVw
Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36 or RAND
Questionnaire)

The SF-36 measures the impact of participants’ health on
physical and mental functioning. [44] The measure results in eight subscales: Physical
Functioning, Role Physical, Bodily Pain, General Health, Social Functioning,
Mental Health, Role Emotional, and Vitality. Higher subscale scores indicate
less impairment. The SF-36 evidences strong psychometric properties, including
good internal consistency and discriminant validity. [45]
Case Definitions



The first category refers to those with chronic fatigue, which
involves 6 or more months of fatigue but cannot be explained by an
exclusionary medical or psychiatric factors, and does not include
individuals classified by the three categories below.



A second category involves more specific criteria that have been
posited both by the IOM report, a Canadian Clinical Case criteria, a ME-ICC
criteria and a more empiric approach specifying domains of post-exertional
malaise, neurocognitive impairment, and sleep dysfunction. [10–11, 37,
40] The diagnosis NDS is
a general term that could represent findings that been suggested by several
groups of researchers. But it should not be thought as of representing the
IOM report, as those criteria had considerable fewer exclusionary
conditions, and tended to prefer the use of comorbidities (in this article,
we have made a separate category for the illnesses that had been considered
exclusionary by prior case definitions). We decided to us the term NDS
rather than CFS or SEID, as neither of these names were recommended by the
CFSAC at the meeting in August of 2015. The term ME/CFS has been suggested
as well, but such a term can be confusing as the Canadian criteria has used
this particular diagnostic label. [10] The NDS label was initially proposed at the CFSAC in
2003 by the Name Change workgroup. Post-exertional malaise items included:
soreness after mild activity, feeling drained or sick after mild activity,
minimum exercise makes you tired, muscle weakness, a dead or heavy feeling
after exercise, and feeling mentally tired after the slightest effort.
Neurocognitive items included: difficulty paying attention, difficulty
expressing thoughts, problems remembering, absent-mindedness, can only focus
on one thing at a time, slowness of thought, and difficulty understanding.
We did not include Orthostatic Intolerance (OI), as our prior work found
that almost all patients who met the cognitive dysfunction domain would
include those with OI. Sleep dysfunction symptoms included: unrefreshing
sleep, problems staying asleep, problems falling asleep, waking up early,
and need to nap daily. Frequency and severity criteria as recommended by the
IOM report were used. Finally, these patients must have had a substantial
reduction in functioning as measured by meeting at least two of the three
following criteria on the SF-36: Role Physical score ≤ 50, Social
Functioning score ≤ 62.5, and Vitality score ≤ 35.



ME criteria proposed by Ramsay [15] were operationalized by Jason,
Damrongvachiraphan, et al. [21] based on past case definitions. This included
Ramsay’s definition, Dowsett et al.’s
“London” criteria, Hyde’s Nightingale definition,
and Goudsmit et al.’s criteria. [13, 17,
19] Patients also
categorized their onset as sudden or gradual, and were asked: “Over
what period of time did your fatigue related illness develop?” The
responses included the following answers: within 24 hours, over 1 week, over
1 month, over 2–6 months, and so on. To meet ME sudden onset
criteria, patients needed to indicate a sudden onset and that their illness
developed either within 24 hours or over 1 week. The major symptom
categories of ME in the revised case definition included: post-exertional
malaise, neurological manifestations, and autonomic dysfunction.
Post-exertional malaise was described as prolonged restoration of muscle
power following either mental or physical exertion with recovery often
taking 2–24 hours or longer. Neurological manifestations included at
least one of the following symptoms: short-term memory loss, loss of
concentration, cognitive dysfunction, increased irritability, confusion, and
perceptual difficulties. Autonomic dysfunction included at least one of the
following: neutrally mediated hypotension, postural orthostatic tachycardia,
delayed postural hypotension, palpitations with or without cardiac
arrhythmias, dizziness, feeling unsteady on ones feet, disturbed balance,
cold extremities, hypersensitivity to climate change, cardiac irregularity,
Raynaud’s phenomenon, circulating blood volume decrease, and
shortness of breath. Secondary features of ME included: pain, endocrine
manifestations, immune manifestations, and sleep dysfunction. To meet full
criteria of ME, patients must have had an acute onset and qualify for the
three major ME symptom categories (post-exertional malaise, neurological
manifestations, and autonomic manifestations).



The fourth category refers to those with chronic fatigue that can be
explained by a number of medical or psychiatric factors, as indicated by
other case definitions such as Fukuda et al. Methods of obtaining this
information did vary by sample, as for samples with a physician diagnosis
(Newcastle and Norway) would be obtained after a medical examination,
whereas with those who just completed the DSQ for the DePaul sample,
symptoms were obtained by self-report.

There has been considerable controversy regarding how to name and
define the illnesses known as myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) and chronic
fatigue syndrome (CFS). The IOM report has proposed a new clinical criteria
and name for this illness, but aspects of these recommendations have been
scrutinized by patients and scientists.

It is possible that both empiric and consensus approaches could be
used to help settle some of these diagnostic challenges. Using patient
samples collected in the United States, Great Britain, and Norway
(N=556), the current study attempted to categorize patients using
more general as well as more restricted case definitions.

Overall, the outcomes suggest that there might be four groupings of
patients, with the broadest category involving those with chronic fatigue
(N=62), defined by 6 or more months of fatigue which can be cannot
be explained by medical or psychiatric conditions. A second category
involves those patients that have chronic fatigue that can be explained by a
medical or psychiatric condition (N=47). A third category involves
more specific criteria that have been posited both by the IOM report, a
Canadian Clinical Case criteria, a ME-ICC criteria and a more empiric
approach. These efforts have specified domains of substantial reductions of
activity, post-exertional malaise, neurocognitive impairment, and sleep
dysfunction (N=346). Patients with these characteristics were more
functionally impaired than those meeting just chronic fatigue criteria,
p < .05. Finally, those meeting even more
restrictive ME criteria proposed by Ramsay, identified a smaller and even
more impaired group, p < .05.

The advantages of using such empirical and consensus approaches to
develop reliable classification and diagnostic efforts are discussed.

Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) has been defined by 20 case definitions, and the
large number of case definitions provide both researchers and clinicians challenges in
both diagnosing and treating patients. [1] The Fukuda et al. [2] case definition of CFS has been the most frequently used, and
epidemiologic studies can provide clues for approaches to categorize patients. According
to one community-based epidemiologic study by Jason et al. [3], about 4% of the population experience 6
or more months of fatigue. Within this group, 19% meet Fukuda et al. criteria,
27% do not meet these Fukuda et al. criteria, and 54% of this group have
a medical or psychiatric (melancholic depression, bipolar disorders, anorexia nervosa or
bulimia nervosa, psychotic disorders, drug or alcohol related disorders) exclusionary
illness.

Unfortunately, the Fukuda et al. [2] criteria have been assessed with different instruments and
operationalized differently. As a result, the rates of CFS prevalence in community-based
samples have ranged widely, from .004 to .0087%, .24%, and .42%
to 2.54% of the population. [3–6] For example,
Reeves et al. [7] attempted to
operationalize the Fukuda et al. [2] criteria, but this effort resulted in broadening of the case
definition. [8] In addition, the
polythetic criteria of Fukuda et al. [2] have been criticized as not requiring fundamental symptoms including
post-exertional malaise. [9] As a
reaction to these criticisms, the Clinical Canadian ME/CFS criteria [10] developed by a group of researchers and
clinicians, which required seven symptoms including post-exertional malaise and
neurocognitive impairment. Later, the Myalgic Encephalomyelitis International Consensus
criteria (ME-ICC) [11] were
developed and they required eight symptoms.

The history of this illness began with an outbreak of epidemic neuromysthenia in
L.A. County [12–13] In a 1956 editorial in the
Lancet, the term “benign myalgic encephalomyelitis”
was coined. [14] Later, Ramsay
[15] published a definition
of this illness using the term “myalgic encephalomyelitis” (ME) and the
term “benign” was dropped due to the seriousness of the disability.
[16] There were later efforts
to operationalize Ramsay’s [15] ME case definition with what are now known as the London criteria.
[17–19]

In one community-based study, these London ME criteria were found to select a
smaller and more symptomatic group of patients than the CFS Fukuda et al [2] criteria. [20] In an effort to better operationalize these ME
criteria based on the work of a number of theorists and practitioners, Jason,
Damrongvachiraphan, et al. [21]
used more precise frequency and severity criteria of symptoms for post-exertional
malaise, neurological manifestation, and autonomic dysfunction. Patients also needed to
have an acute onset to meet this ME criteria. When Jason, Brown et al. [22] applied these revised ME criteria to a
data set of patients in a tertiary sample diagnosed with CFS using the Fukuda et al.
[2] criteria, only 24%
met these ME criteria, and they were more functionally impaired than those that just met
the Fukuda et al. criteria. Later, Jason, Evans, Brown, Sunnquist, and Newton
[23] found that 29.6%
of a CFS sample in the US, and 17.7% of a CFS sample in England met these ME
criteria. The more restrictive ME criteria appear to select a smaller group of patients
than the Fukuda et al. [2]
criteria, and those selected with ME are more impaired.

The Canadian Clinical ME/CFS Criteria [10] in contrast to the Fukuda et al. [2] criteria has been found to select cases with less
psychiatric comorbidity, more physical functioning impairment, more fatigue or weakness,
and more neuropsychiatric and neurological symptoms [24], and comparable findings emerged in another study
by Jason, Brown, et al. [25].
When Jason, Brown, Evans, Sunnquist, and Newton [26] utilized three different samples of patients, each collected
through a different case ascertainment method, 87 to 96% of the samples met the
Fukuda et al. [2] case definition
criteria, whereas only 73 to 77% met the Canadian ME/CFS criteria.
Unfortunately, a study by Johnston, Brenu, Staines, and Marshall-Gradisnik’s
[27] found that only one
study reported prevalence rates according to these Canadian Consensus criteria.

The more recently developed ME-ICC criteria [11] also identified a group of patients with more
functional impairments and physical, mental, and cognitive problems than the larger
group of patients who met the Fukuda et al. criteria. [28] In a larger study with samples from the US and
Great Britain, Jason, Sunnquist, Brown, Evans, and Newton [29] found from 57 to 58% met the ME-ICC case
definition, whereas the Fukuda et al. criteria identified a larger group of patients.
Johnston, Brenu, Hardcastle, Huth, Staines, and Marshall-Gradisnik [30] also found that patients fulfilling the
ME-ICC criteria reported significantly lower scores for physical functioning, role
physical, bodily pain, social functioning as well as greater disability than those who
met the Fukuda et al. [2]
criteria.

These different definitions and criteria provide substantial problems for
investigators, because if case definitions have different symptoms, which are measured
in different ways, then criterion variance is introduced. If diagnostic categories are
unreliable, then this will have problematic consequences for estimating prevalence rates
or finding biological markers. Empirical approaches might help specify which symptoms
and domains have both the needed sensitivity and specificity for the case definitions.

could accurately identify patients and controls. Hawk, Jason and Torres-Harding
[34] also found these domains
were able to successfully differentiate patients with CFS from Major Depressive
Disorder. Although a moderate percentage of the CFS group reports other important
symptoms within pain, autonomic, immune, and neuroendocrine domains, they are less
prominent.

Using factor analytic approaches, Brown and Jason [35] found a three-factor solution: Neuroendocrine,
Autonomic, and Immune Dysfunction; Neurological/Cognitive Dysfunction; and
Post-Exertional Malaise. In a more recent study with a large data set of 788 patients,
Jason, Sunnquist et al. [36]

post-exertional malaise, and sleep, fit well with previous literature indicating that

Demographic Characteristics

Table 1 provides a comparison of
the demographic characteristics of the patient in each diagnostic category.
There were no significant differences on any of the demographic characteristics
between illness groups, p > .05.

Illness Groups



Table 2 provides a comparison
of the presence of symptoms and symptom domains of the patients in each
illness group with at least moderate severity and presence at least half of
the time in the past six months. Significance of χ2 tests
are displayed in the table. Symptoms were significantly more likely to be
present in the NDS, ME, and Exclusion groups as compared to the CF group.
The ME group was more likely to have pain [χ2 (1)
= 4.02, p < .05] and orthostatic
intolerance [χ2 (1) = 4.05,
p < .05] present compared to the NDS
group.

Table 3 provides a comparison
of the mean and standard deviations of symptom and domain composites for
patients in each illness group. There were significant effects of illness
groups on mean composite scores (p < .05) in each domain
and individual symptom, with the exception of the low temperature symptom.
Using the Games-Howell post hoc comparison, it was determined that the CF
group differed significantly from the Exclusions, NDS, and ME groups with

Discussion

Our study suggests that there might be different groupings of patients who
have significant limitations in energy and endurance. The most consistent finding
was that those with CF were the most differentiated from the other three groups on
both symptoms and functional limitations. Although the differences in symptoms are
not too surprising as the CF group did not have ratings of frequency or severity of
symptoms to meet the NDS and ME criteria. Among the NDS, ME and exclusionary group,
the latter had directionally more functional limitations and had the highest percent
of patients who were bedbound. However, this group is rather diverse, as it is
composed of individuals with multiple types of medical and psychiatric illnesses.
The ME group had more functional limitations than the NDS group, and fewer symptoms
that predated their fatiguing illness. Overall, this investigation suggests that
both consensus efforts to differentiate illness groups as well as more empiric
efforts does appear to have some validity.

The study suggests that the term CF could be used to designate a broad
criteria, as has been used in the US and Britain. The term NDS (or ME/CFS as
proposed by the CFSAC at the August 2015 meeting) has comparable symptoms to the
SEID criteria, and these core symptoms are also within the Canadian ME/CFS criteria,
the ME-ICC criteria or the more empirically based ME criteria. [10–11, 37, 40] The ME criteria identify a much smaller
percent of patients with more sudden onset of infectious symptoms, with fewer
predating symptoms. In addition, whereas the Fukuda et al. [2] CFS criteria, the ME/CFS Canadian criteria
[10] and the ME-ICC
criteria [11] excluded other
medical and psychiatric conditions that might have produced the fatigue and other
symptoms, the new IOM [37]
criteria regarded most other illnesses as comorbid rather than exclusionary.
[39] This issue is still
being debated, but the CFSAC meeting of August 2015 has recommended maintaining the
exclusionary criteria, somewhat comparable to previous case definitions. The CFSAC
is represented by scientists, patients, and government officials and makes
recommendations on CFS and ME to the Secretary of Health and Human Resources.

The differences in CF and NDS might also help us better understand why
tertiary care samples appear to be more impaired than those from community-based
samples. [46] In a CDC
community-based epidemiology study in Wichita, Kansas [5], Nisenbaum et al. [47] provided percentages of symptoms for 65
individuals classified as having CFS. Unusual fatigue post-exertion was found in
78.5%, and difficulty thinking/concentrating or memory problems was found in
76.9%. The percentages of these classic CFS symptoms tend to be low,
suggesting an identified CFS group with fewer core symptoms. In Wessely et
al.’s [48] British
community based sample, 36 individuals were diagnosed as having CFS. Among this
group, only 64% had sleep disturbances and 63% had post-exertional
malaise. These percentages are again rather low, as both symptoms are critical
features of CFS. It is quite possible that these individuals have CF rather than
NDS, and this is reflected in other findings as well suggesting less impairment. For
example, in the CDC study, 58 patients with CFS were brought back for a two day
inpatient study that occurred from December 2002 to July 2003, and only 16
(28% of the original group diagnosed with CFS) had a current diagnosis of
CFS. But within tertiary care settings, less than 10% of patients with CFS
recovery, so it is very possible that some of the patients within the
community-based samples had CF rather than NDS. [5, 47, 49–50]

It is also possible that because those with CF are less impaired that than
those with NDS, they might be more likely to benefit from the non-pharmacologic
interventions. In addition, those with psychiatric reasons for their fatigue might
also be more likely to benefit from the non-pharmacologic interventions. In support
of this proposition, Jason et al. [51] found that those with the most severe immune baseline
characteristics tended to be non-improvers within non-pharmacologic interventions.
Jason et al. [52] also found
that patients with CFS with normal baseline cortisol evidenced improvements on a
number of immunologic and self-report measures, whereas patients most impaired on
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) functioning at baseline were least able to
improve when provided rehabilitation interventions. If those with a more severe
illness, such as having NDS and ME, are mixed with those with CF and those with
exclusionary illnesses, it might be more difficult to determine therapeutic outcomes
for clinical studies.

There is a need for more studies to use the new criteria of the IOM.
[37] The present study
used some of these criteria, except for one symptom involving cognitive impairment
or orthostatic intolerance (but similar results would have been found if we had used
this criteria). In addition, the IOM criteria regard most other illnesses as
comorbid rather than exclusionary, and as this issue is still being debated. Our
current study suggests that the exclusionary group might be different in some
important ways from those with just the other IOM criteria, and perhaps for the
research criteria that are developed, eliminating patients with these exclusionary
illnesses very likely would reduce subject heterogeneity.

The current study has several limitations. Most notably, the patient samples
merged were from convenience samples as well as from samples that were evaluated by
a medical specialist. We have published another paper that suggests that there are
differences between our British and US samples. [53] We did analyze the Norway, Great Britain, and
US samples separately, and found comparable results, although reduced power did
affect some significant findings. In general, we felt that it was important to merge
samples for the current study, and demographic differences as well as differences in
ways cases were ascertained provided us a more generalizable data set, increasing
external validity.

The IOM diagnostic criteria are clinical rather than research criteria. Even
though the IOM SEID was developed to be a clinical diagnostic criteria, and not a
research criteria, as we know, the Fukuda et al. CFS criteria tended to be used both
for research and clinical purposes, although that was not the original intention of
it. In addition, when the Canadian clinical criteria were developed, they have also
been used for both purposes. So, when only one type of criteria is announced and
disseminated, there is always the possibility of it being used for both clinical and
research purposes. Clearly, what is needed is both a research and clinical criteria,
and there would probably be less confusion had both been worked on and disseminated
at the same time. We do need both a research and clinical criteria, and hopefully
this will occur in the future.

Of course one might criticize the use of self-report in the DePaul sample
for making the diagnosis of a psychiatric exclusion, however, research
[54] has found that
physicians are likely to report high rates of overdiagnosis and misdiagnosis as
well. That said, having all patients complete a structured clinical interview is
best practice and the absence of this type of interview is a study limitation.

Our scientific enterprise depends on valid methods of classifying patients
into diagnostic categories, and this basic research has important implications for
research in areas such as etiology, pathophysiology, and treatment. It is only
through ongoing data collection that we can provide the perspectives and analyses
that can be used by gatekeepers representing scientists, patients and government
groups to make the types of recommendations that will provide a sturdier foundation
for identify cases. We continue to believe that cardinal factors including cognitive
dysfunction, post-exertional malaise, and sleep help us identify those with more
severe illness versus those with milder CF. [29, 55] In addition, even
within this broader NDS category, there might very well be those who are represent
either a separate illness category or are more severe cases, and such individuals
might represent those within what Ramsay [15] called ME. Those with more general criteria of NDS could
represent a clinical criteria, which is what the IOM attempted to identify, whereas
those with a more research criteria could be represented by either the Canadian
criteria, which was recommended by the CFSAC at their August 2015 meeting, or a more
sudden onset ME group that was described in the current study. [10, 15,
37] Whatever diagnostic system
that is ultimately specified, it is critical that scientists world-wide develop
consensus on how to identify and classify patients using clinical and research
criteria, and one day develop subtypes within such categories.

There has been considerable controversy regarding how to name and
define the illnesses known as myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) and chronic
fatigue syndrome (CFS). The IOM report has proposed a new clinical criteria
and name for this illness, but aspects of these recommendations have been
scrutinized by patients and scientists.

It is possible that both empiric and consensus approaches could be
used to help settle some of these diagnostic challenges. Using patient
samples collected in the United States, Great Britain, and Norway
(N=556), the current study attempted to categorize patients using
more general as well as more restricted case definitions.

Overall, the outcomes suggest that there might be four groupings of
patients, with the broadest category involving those with chronic fatigue
(N=62), defined by 6 or more months of fatigue which can be cannot
be explained by medical or psychiatric conditions. A second category
involves those patients that have chronic fatigue that can be explained by a
medical or psychiatric condition (N=47). A third category involves
more specific criteria that have been posited both by the IOM report, a
Canadian Clinical Case criteria, a ME-ICC criteria and a more empiric
approach. These efforts have specified domains of substantial reductions of
activity, post-exertional malaise, neurocognitive impairment, and sleep
dysfunction (N=346). Patients with these characteristics were more
functionally impaired than those meeting just chronic fatigue criteria,
p < .05. Finally, those meeting even more
restrictive ME criteria proposed by Ramsay, identified a smaller and even
more impaired group, p < .05.

The advantages of using such empirical and consensus approaches to
develop reliable classification and diagnostic efforts are discussed.

Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) has been defined by 20 case definitions, and the
large number of case definitions provide both researchers and clinicians challenges in
both diagnosing and treating patients. [1] The Fukuda et al. [2] case definition of CFS has been the most frequently used, and
epidemiologic studies can provide clues for approaches to categorize patients. According
to one community-based epidemiologic study by Jason et al. [3], about 4% of the population experience 6
or more months of fatigue. Within this group, 19% meet Fukuda et al. criteria,
27% do not meet these Fukuda et al. criteria, and 54% of this group have
a medical or psychiatric (melancholic depression, bipolar disorders, anorexia nervosa or
bulimia nervosa, psychotic disorders, drug or alcohol related disorders) exclusionary
illness.

Unfortunately, the Fukuda et al. [2] criteria have been assessed with different instruments and
operationalized differently. As a result, the rates of CFS prevalence in community-based
samples have ranged widely, from .004 to .0087%, .24%, and .42%
to 2.54% of the population. [3–6] For example,
Reeves et al. [7] attempted to
operationalize the Fukuda et al. [2] criteria, but this effort resulted in broadening of the case
definition. [8] In addition, the
polythetic criteria of Fukuda et al. [2] have been criticized as not requiring fundamental symptoms including
post-exertional malaise. [9] As a
reaction to these criticisms, the Clinical Canadian ME/CFS criteria [10] developed by a group of researchers and
clinicians, which required seven symptoms including post-exertional malaise and
neurocognitive impairment. Later, the Myalgic Encephalomyelitis International Consensus
criteria (ME-ICC) [11] were
developed and they required eight symptoms.

The history of this illness began with an outbreak of epidemic neuromysthenia in
L.A. County [12–13] In a 1956 editorial in the
Lancet, the term “benign myalgic encephalomyelitis”
was coined. [14] Later, Ramsay
[15] published a definition
of this illness using the term “myalgic encephalomyelitis” (ME) and the
term “benign” was dropped due to the seriousness of the disability.
[16] There were later efforts
to operationalize Ramsay’s [15] ME case definition with what are now known as the London criteria.
[17–19]

In one community-based study, these London ME criteria were found to select a
smaller and more symptomatic group of patients than the CFS Fukuda et al [2] criteria. [20] In an effort to better operationalize these ME
criteria based on the work of a number of theorists and practitioners, Jason,
Damrongvachiraphan, et al. [21]
used more precise frequency and severity criteria of symptoms for post-exertional
malaise, neurological manifestation, and autonomic dysfunction. Patients also needed to
have an acute onset to meet this ME criteria. When Jason, Brown et al. [22] applied these revised ME criteria to a
data set of patients in a tertiary sample diagnosed with CFS using the Fukuda et al.
[2] criteria, only 24%
met these ME criteria, and they were more functionally impaired than those that just met
the Fukuda et al. criteria. Later, Jason, Evans, Brown, Sunnquist, and Newton
[23] found that 29.6%
of a CFS sample in the US, and 17.7% of a CFS sample in England met these ME
criteria. The more restrictive ME criteria appear to select a smaller group of patients
than the Fukuda et al. [2]
criteria, and those selected with ME are more impaired.

The Canadian Clinical ME/CFS Criteria [10] in contrast to the Fukuda et al. [2] criteria has been found to select cases with less
psychiatric comorbidity, more physical functioning impairment, more fatigue or weakness,
and more neuropsychiatric and neurological symptoms [24], and comparable findings emerged in another study
by Jason, Brown, et al. [25].
When Jason, Brown, Evans, Sunnquist, and Newton [26] utilized three different samples of patients, each collected
through a different case ascertainment method, 87 to 96% of the samples met the
Fukuda et al. [2] case definition
criteria, whereas only 73 to 77% met the Canadian ME/CFS criteria.
Unfortunately, a study by Johnston, Brenu, Staines, and Marshall-Gradisnik’s
[27] found that only one
study reported prevalence rates according to these Canadian Consensus criteria.

The more recently developed ME-ICC criteria [11] also identified a group of patients with more
functional impairments and physical, mental, and cognitive problems than the larger
group of patients who met the Fukuda et al. criteria. [28] In a larger study with samples from the US and
Great Britain, Jason, Sunnquist, Brown, Evans, and Newton [29] found from 57 to 58% met the ME-ICC case
definition, whereas the Fukuda et al. criteria identified a larger group of patients.
Johnston, Brenu, Hardcastle, Huth, Staines, and Marshall-Gradisnik [30] also found that patients fulfilling the
ME-ICC criteria reported significantly lower scores for physical functioning, role
physical, bodily pain, social functioning as well as greater disability than those who
met the Fukuda et al. [2]
criteria.

These different definitions and criteria provide substantial problems for
investigators, because if case definitions have different symptoms, which are measured
in different ways, then criterion variance is introduced. If diagnostic categories are
unreliable, then this will have problematic consequences for estimating prevalence rates
or finding biological markers. Empirical approaches might help specify which symptoms
and domains have both the needed sensitivity and specificity for the case definitions.
More empirical methods have been used to identify symptoms that differentiate CFS
samples from controls. [31–32] For example, Jason, Kot, et al.
[33] used data mining
techniques to separate patients with CFS from controls. Outcomes from these analyses
suggest that individuals identified using fewer, but empirically selected, symptoms
(i.e., fatigue or extreme tiredness, physically drained/sick after mild activity,
difficulty finding the right word to say or expressing thoughts, and unrefreshing sleep)
could accurately identify patients and controls. Hawk, Jason and Torres-Harding
[34] also found these domains
were able to successfully differentiate patients with CFS from Major Depressive
Disorder. Although a moderate percentage of the CFS group reports other important
symptoms within pain, autonomic, immune, and neuroendocrine domains, they are less
prominent.

Using factor analytic approaches, Brown and Jason [35] found a three-factor solution: Neuroendocrine,
Autonomic, and Immune Dysfunction; Neurological/Cognitive Dysfunction; and
Post-Exertional Malaise. In a more recent study with a large data set of 788 patients,
Jason, Sunnquist et al. [36]
found a 4-factor solution. Three of these factors, cognitive dysfunction,
post-exertional malaise, and sleep, fit well with previous literature indicating that
these are cardinal symptom clusters. A combined factor involving neuroendocrine,
autonomic and immune dysfunction symptoms suggests that neuroendocrine, autonomic, and
immune areas that occur at lower rates than the more core domains might be better
thought of as subtypes of the illness. These investigators next used an exploratory
factor analysis to examine solely the items within this heterogeneous factor. The
results indicate that circulatory/neuroendocrine impairment, orthostatic intolerance,
and gastro-intestinal distress could be thought of as subtypes.

A new name for CFS and a new clinical criteria has recently been proposed by the
Institute of Medicine [37] in the
US. The new name is Systemic Exertion Intolerance Disease (SEID), and the new clinical
criteria requires the following four symptoms: substantial reduction or impairment in
the ability to engage in pre-illness levels of occupational, educational, social, or
personal activities; post-exertional malaise; unrefreshing sleep; and at least one of
the two following symptoms: cognitive impairment or orthostatic intolerance. SEID is
clinical criteria and was designed for clinicians who may require less rigor in their
diagnostic assessment of patients with CFS. Jason, Sunnquist, and Brown et al.
[38] analyzed archival
samples from tertiary care settings which included seven hundred and ninety-six patients
from the USA, Great Britain, and Norway. If investigators begin to compare and contrast
the SEID criteria with other existing criteria, it would be of some importance for the
scientific community to be informed of the consequences. For example, our findings
indicated that the SEID criteria identified 88% of participants in the samples
analyzed, which was comparable to the 92% that met the Fukuda criteria. However,
the samples selected had already been screened for exclusionary illnesses. Because the
SEID criteria have few exclusionary conditions, when other data sets were examined that
had other illness groups, a study by Jason, Sunnquist et al. [39] found that the SEID prevalence rate would be 2.8
times as great as the rate found when the Fukuda et al. [2] criteria were applied. In addition, the erroneous
inclusion of individuals with primary psychiatric conditions in SEID samples would have
detrimental consequences for the interpretation of epidemiologic, etiologic, and
treatment efficacy findings for people with this illness. For example, 47% of a
sample of individuals with melancholic depression met SEID criteria. It should be noted
that these studies were not prospective, and the SEID criteria were not directly
assessed in these patients; instead, symptoms meant to represent the criteria were
examined in a cohort that was diagnosed using different diagnostic criteria.

In the large sample described by Jason, Sunnquist et al. [39], the four-item empiric criteria
[40] identified only
61% of patients whereas ME criteria identified even fewer at 20%. It
appears that the Fukuda et al. [2]
criteria includes more patients, with fewer being identified with the Canadian
ME/CFS[10], ME-ICC criteria
[11], or empiric criteria
[40], with still fewer
meeting the London ME criteria described by Jason, Damrongvachiraphan, et al.
[21].

The present study classified patients into four groupings of patients. The
exclusionary condition is composed of patients that have chronic fatigue which can be
explained by a medical or psychiatric factor. At the Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Advisory
Committee (CFSAC) in August of 2015, a recommendation was voted on and approved
regarding treating exclusionary illnesses as has occurred with other case definitions,
which is a departure from the IOM report. [2, 10, 37] A second grouping is chronic fatigue, which
involves 6 or more months of fatigue which cannot be explained by a medical or
psychiatric factor. A third category involves more specific criteria that have been
posited both by the IOM report, a Canadian Clinical Case criteria, a ME-ICC criteria and
a more empiric approach [10–11, 40] specifying domains of post-exertional malaise, neurocognitive
impairment, and sleep dysfunction, as well as substantial reductions in activity; we
hypothesized that this group was more functionally impaired than those meeting just
chronic fatigue criteria. Finally, those meeting more restrictive ME criteria proposed
by Ramsay [15] and the London
criteria [17] were hypothesized
to identify a smaller more impaired group.

Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) has been defined by 20 case definitions, and the
large number of case definitions provide both researchers and clinicians challenges in
both diagnosing and treating patients. [1] The Fukuda et al. [2] case definition of CFS has been the most frequently used, and
epidemiologic studies can provide clues for approaches to categorize patients. According
to one community-based epidemiologic study by Jason et al. [3], about 4% of the population experience 6

27% do not meet these Fukuda et al. criteria, and 54% of this group have
a medical or psychiatric (melancholic depression, bipolar disorders, anorexia nervosa or

illness.

In one community-based study, these London ME criteria were found to select a

than the Fukuda et al. [2]

The Canadian Clinical ME/CFS Criteria [10] in contrast to the Fukuda et al. [2] criteria has been found to select cases with less
psychiatric comorbidity, more physical functioning impairment, more fatigue or weakness,
and more neuropsychiatric and neurological symptoms [24], and comparable findings emerged in another study

When Jason, Brown, Evans, Sunnquist, and Newton [26] utilized three different samples of patients, each collected

criteria, whereas only 73 to 77% met the Canadian ME/CFS criteria.
Unfortunately, a study by Johnston, Brenu, Staines, and Marshall-Gradisnik’s
[27] found that only one
study reported prevalence rates according to these Canadian Consensus criteria.

The more recently developed ME-ICC criteria [11] also identified a group of patients with more
functional impairments and physical, mental, and cognitive problems than the larger
group of patients who met the Fukuda et al. criteria. [28] In a larger study with samples from the US and
Great Britain, Jason, Sunnquist, Brown, Evans, and Newton [29] found from 57 to 58% met the ME-ICC case
definition, whereas the Fukuda et al. criteria identified a larger group of patients.
Johnston, Brenu, Hardcastle, Huth, Staines, and Marshall-Gradisnik [30] also found that patients fulfilling the
ME-ICC criteria reported significantly lower scores for physical functioning, role
physical, bodily pain, social functioning as well as greater disability than those who
met the Fukuda et al. [2]
criteria.

These different definitions and criteria provide substantial problems for
investigators, because if case definitions have different symptoms, which are measured
in different ways, then criterion variance is introduced. If diagnostic categories are
unreliable, then this will have problematic consequences for estimating prevalence rates
or finding biological markers. Empirical approaches might help specify which symptoms
and domains have both the needed sensitivity and specificity for the case definitions.
More empirical methods have been used to identify symptoms that differentiate CFS
samples from controls. [31–32] For example, Jason, Kot, et al.
[33] used data mining
techniques to separate patients with CFS from controls. Outcomes from these analyses
suggest that individuals identified using fewer, but empirically selected, symptoms
(i.e., fatigue or extreme tiredness, physically drained/sick after mild activity,
difficulty finding the right word to say or expressing thoughts, and unrefreshing sleep)
could accurately identify patients and controls. Hawk, Jason and Torres-Harding
[34] also found these domains
were able to successfully differentiate patients with CFS from Major Depressive
Disorder. Although a moderate percentage of the CFS group reports other important
symptoms within pain, autonomic, immune, and neuroendocrine domains, they are less
prominent.

Using factor analytic approaches, Brown and Jason [35] found a three-factor solution: Neuroendocrine,
Autonomic, and Immune Dysfunction; Neurological/Cognitive Dysfunction; and
Post-Exertional Malaise. In a more recent study with a large data set of 788 patients,
Jason, Sunnquist et al. [36]
found a 4-factor solution. Three of these factors, cognitive dysfunction,
post-exertional malaise, and sleep, fit well with previous literature indicating that
these are cardinal symptom clusters. A combined factor involving neuroendocrine,
autonomic and immune dysfunction symptoms suggests that neuroendocrine, autonomic, and
immune areas that occur at lower rates than the more core domains might be better
thought of as subtypes of the illness. These investigators next used an exploratory
factor analysis to examine solely the items within this heterogeneous factor. The
results indicate that circulatory/neuroendocrine impairment, orthostatic intolerance,
and gastro-intestinal distress could be thought of as subtypes.

A new name for CFS and a new clinical criteria has recently been proposed by the
Institute of Medicine [37] in the
US. The new name is Systemic Exertion Intolerance Disease (SEID), and the new clinical
criteria requires the following four symptoms: substantial reduction or impairment in
the ability to engage in pre-illness levels of occupational, educational, social, or
personal activities; post-exertional malaise; unrefreshing sleep; and at least one of
the two following symptoms: cognitive impairment or orthostatic intolerance. SEID is
clinical criteria and was designed for clinicians who may require less rigor in their
diagnostic assessment of patients with CFS. Jason, Sunnquist, and Brown et al.
[38] analyzed archival
samples from tertiary care settings which included seven hundred and ninety-six patients
from the USA, Great Britain, and Norway. If investigators begin to compare and contrast
the SEID criteria with other existing criteria, it would be of some importance for the
scientific community to be informed of the consequences. For example, our findings
indicated that the SEID criteria identified 88% of participants in the samples
analyzed, which was comparable to the 92% that met the Fukuda criteria. However,
the samples selected had already been screened for exclusionary illnesses. Because the
SEID criteria have few exclusionary conditions, when other data sets were examined that
had other illness groups, a study by Jason, Sunnquist et al. [39] found that the SEID prevalence rate would be 2.8
times as great as the rate found when the Fukuda et al. [2] criteria were applied. In addition, the erroneous
inclusion of individuals with primary psychiatric conditions in SEID samples would have
detrimental consequences for the interpretation of epidemiologic, etiologic, and
treatment efficacy findings for people with this illness. For example, 47% of a
sample of individuals with melancholic depression met SEID criteria. It should be noted
that these studies were not prospective, and the SEID criteria were not directly
assessed in these patients; instead, symptoms meant to represent the criteria were
examined in a cohort that was diagnosed using different diagnostic criteria.

In the large sample described by Jason, Sunnquist et al. [39], the four-item empiric criteria
[40] identified only
61% of patients whereas ME criteria identified even fewer at 20%. It
appears that the Fukuda et al. [2]
criteria includes more patients, with fewer being identified with the Canadian
ME/CFS[10], ME-ICC criteria
[11], or empiric criteria
[40], with still fewer
meeting the London ME criteria described by Jason, Damrongvachiraphan, et al.
[21].

The present study classified patients into four groupings of patients. The
exclusionary condition is composed of patients that have chronic fatigue which can be
explained by a medical or psychiatric factor. At the Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Advisory
Committee (CFSAC) in August of 2015, a recommendation was voted on and approved
regarding treating exclusionary illnesses as has occurred with other case definitions,
which is a departure from the IOM report. [2, 10, 37] A second grouping is chronic fatigue, which
involves 6 or more months of fatigue which cannot be explained by a medical or
psychiatric factor. A third category involves more specific criteria that have been
posited both by the IOM report, a Canadian Clinical Case criteria, a ME-ICC criteria and
a more empiric approach [10–11, 40] specifying domains of post-exertional malaise, neurocognitive
impairment, and sleep dysfunction, as well as substantial reductions in activity; we
hypothesized that this group was more functionally impaired than those meeting just
chronic fatigue criteria. Finally, those meeting more restrictive ME criteria proposed
by Ramsay [15] and the London
criteria [17] were hypothesized
to identify a smaller more impaired group.
