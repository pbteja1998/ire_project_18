Meta-Analysis of Anti-Toxoplasma gondii IgM Antibodies in Acute Psychosis.

Abstract

Introduction: A number of different infections are associated with acute psychosis. However, relationships between infections and acute psychosis in patients with schizophrenia have not been extensively explored. Exposure to Toxoplasma gondii is a replicated risk factor for schizophrenia. Previous studies have focused on T. gondii IgG antibodies, which are a marker of lifetime exposure, whereas IgM antibodies are a marker of acute/recent exposure, persistent infection, or reinfection. We performed a meta-analysis of T. gondii IgM antibodies and acute psychosis, to further investigate whether infections may be associated with relapse in schizophrenia. Methods: We identified articles by systematic searches of PubMed, PsycINFO, and ISI databases. We included studies, in English, of serum T. gondii IgM antibodies in patients with acute psychosis and controls. Results: Sixteen independent samples (2353 patients and 1707 controls) met inclusion criteria. Data were pooled using a random effects model. There was a significant increase in risk of positive T. gondii IgM antibodies in acute psychosis compared with controls (7.6% vs 5.7%, OR = 1.68, 95% CI = 1.23–2.27, P = .001). The association was stronger for patients with chronic schizophrenia (8.7% vs 4.6%, OR = 2.54, 95% CI = 1.63–3.96, P < .001) than first-episode psychosis. In meta-regression analyses, age, sex, and publication year were unrelated to the association; however, there was a significant association with geographic region. Discussion: An increased seroprevalence of T. gondii IgM in patients with acute psychosis complements and extends previous findings, suggesting that infections may be relevant to the etiopathophysiology of relapse in some patients with schizophrenia.

Introduction

Schizophrenia is associated with increased infections across the lifespan. Prenatal maternal infection, with a variety of different infectious agents, is a replicated risk factor for schizophrenia1 and may act synergistically with family history of psychosis.2 Hospital contact for infection during childhood or adolescence is associated with an increased risk of schizophrenia.3 Schizophrenia is also associated with increased mortality from infectious diseases, including pneumonia and influenza.4,5 Outside of schizophrenia, a number of different viral, bacterial, and parasitic infections are associated with acute psychosis, a notable example being geriatric patients with psychosis and a comorbid urinary tract infection (UTI) in the context of either dementia or delirium.6,7 However, relationships between infections and acute psychosis in patients with schizophrenia have not been extensively explored.

Acute psychosis is common and relapse prevention represents an important treatment issue in schizophrenia. Robinson et al8 found that 82% of patients with first-episode psychosis (FEP) had an illness relapse within 5 years after recovery, and a majority had multiple relapses. Illness relapse is associated with adverse outcomes, including increased treatment-resistant symptoms, cognitive decline, and functional disability.9–11 Thus, to better understand and predict relapse in schizophrenia is a compelling opportunity and public health priority.

Exposure to Toxoplasma gondii is a robust risk factor for schizophrenia. A meta-analysis found that subjects with FEP have a 2.5-fold increased risk of lifetime infection compared with controls, and a similar 2.7-fold increased risk of lifetime infection across all clinical phases of schizophrenia.12 Most previous studies have focused on T. gondii IgG antibodies, which are a marker of lifetime exposure to toxoplasmosis, whereas IgM antibodies are a marker of acute/recent infection,13 or also potentially persistent infection or reinfection, possibly with a different genotype.14–18 The objective of this study was to perform a meta-analysis of the association between T. gondii IgM antibodies and acute psychosis in schizophrenia, to further investigate whether infections may be associated with relapse in schizophrenia. We hypothesize that there is an increased seroprevalence of T. gondii antibodies in patients with acute psychosis compared with controls.

Study Selection

Studies of T. gondii IgM antibodies in schizophrenia were systematically searched using Medline (PubMed, National Center for Biotechnology Information, US National Library of Medicine, Bethesda, MD), PsycINFO (via Ovid, American Psychological Association, Washington, DC), and Thomson Reuters (formerly ISI) Web of Knowledge (Science Citation Index and Social Sciences Citation Index, Thomson Reuters, Charlottesville, VA) from 1953 (when the first known study of T. gondii antibodies in patients with psychosis was published) through October 26, 2013, when the final search procedure was conducted. The primary search strategy was “(toxoplasma OR toxoplasmosis) AND (psychosis OR schizophrenia),” which yielded 160 articles from PubMed, 78 for PsycINFO, and 251 for ISI. Titles and abstracts of the resulting matches were screened for relevance to the present meta-analysis. The inclusion criteria were (1) case-control studies of serum T. gondii IgM antibodies in patients with acute psychosis in the context of schizophrenia or related psychotic spectrum disorders (including schizophreniform disorder, brief psychotic disorder, psychotic disorder not otherwise specified, delusional disorder, and schizoaffective disorder) and healthy controls, (2) the study had to be published, and (3) studies or abstracts had to be written in English. Patients with acute psychosis were further stratified by FEP or chronic schizophrenia. For studies that included patients with both FEP and chronic schizophrenia, if stratified data were not presented in the manuscript, we attempted to contact study authors. The exclusion criteria were: (1) studies that measured T. gondii IgG, but not IgM antibodies, (2) studies without a control group, (3) significant overlap in study population, (4) studies that assayed prenatal or antenatal samples, (5) studies of subjects at clinical high risk for psychosis, (6) studies of subjects with affective psychosis, and (7) review articles without primary data. For studies that measured both anti-T.
gondii IgG and IgM antibodies, if stratified data were not presented in the manuscript, we attempted to contact study authors.

From these sources, as well as a hand-searched review of reference lists, we identified 116 studies for potential inclusion. We did not employ formal search software and all publications were retrieved and examined in full text. Based on a preliminary review of these matches, 28 studies presented data on T. gondii IgM antibodies and warranted further consideration.19–46 These studies are summarized in table 1. The majority of initial matches were excluded because they did not present data on T. gondii IgM antibodies or were review articles. After independent searches, detailed review of study methods by 2 authors (J.M.M. and B.J.M.) and attempts to contact study authors, 16 studies met the inclusion criteria, with 4 studies of FEP, 10 studies of chronic schizophrenia, and 2 studies of both FEP and chronic schizophrenia (15–30). Twelve studies were excluded from the final analysis due to: data on the prevalence of positive IgM antibodies not available (n = 5), uncertainty if patients were experiencing acute psychosis (n = 3), no control group (n = 2), patients not experiencing acute psychosis (n = 1), and significant overlap in study population (n = 1). There was universal agreement on the included studies. A flowchart summarizing the study selection process is presented in figure 1.

Data Extraction and Meta-Analysis

Data were extracted for sample size and number of subjects seropositive for T. gondii IgM antibodies for acute psychosis and controls in each study. We also extracted descriptive data on geographic location, assay method, age, and sex. One author (B.J.M.) extracted all data, which was independently verified by another author (J.M.M.). Effect size estimates (ORs and 95% CIs) were aggregated utilizing the random effects method of DerSimonian and Laird.47 Random effects methods are considered to be more representative of real-world data in comparison to the alternative fixed effect approach48 and provide a more conservative estimate of the average weighted effect size.49 Random effects models also yield their actual first error rate while fixed effect models tend to inflate their first error rate. CIs obtained by fixed effect models are also biased and their actual coverage rate is smaller than their nominal coverage rate.50 Three studies that otherwise met the inclusion criteria could not be analyzed in the random effects meta-analysis because the prevalence of T. gondii IgM antibodies was zero for both acute psychosis and control groups, which results in an OR and 95% CI that is undefined.23,29,32 The main statistical hypothesis was that the ORs for the seroprevalence of T. gondii IgM in patients with acute psychosis vs controls equals 1.00. In a secondary analysis, we repeated the meta-analysis procedure for studies of FEP and chronic schizophrenia (each vs controls) considered separately.

The meta-analysis procedure also calculates a χ
2 value for the heterogeneity in effect size estimates, which is based on Cochran’s Q-statistic,51 and I
2, the proportion of the variation in effect size attributable to between-study heterogeneity. Between-study heterogeneity χ
2 was considered significant for P < .10.52 For all studies, and studies of chronic schizophrenia, between-study heterogeneity χ
2 was significant, so we performed a sensitivity analysis. This was done by removing one study at a time and repeating the meta-analysis procedure, to examine its impact on the OR and between-study heterogeneity.53 Given the significant heterogeneity in the overall result, we also performed a series of meta-regressions to explore possible moderating variables to account for such heterogeneity. Meta-regression assesses and adjusts the effects of potential moderating variables on the effect size estimate from the meta-analysis (much in the same way that regression assesses the relationships between moderating variables and a dependent variable). A positive slope (ie, regression coefficient) means that the effect size estimate from the meta-analysis and the moderator variable change in the same direction, and a negative slope means they change in the opposite direction. We conducted meta-regression analyses of age, sex, geographic location (latitude and longitude, considered separately, as well as region), and year of publication. As 14 of the 16 studies measured T. gondii IgM using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, we did not perform a meta-regression with assay method. Potential for publication bias was examined by means of Sterne’s funnel plot analysis54 and Egger’s regression intercept.55 The statistical analyses were performed in Stata 10.0 (StataCorp LP).56 All tests were 2-sided, and P values were considered statistically significant at the α = .05 level.

Results

As described in table 1, search procedures yielded 16 independent studies, comprising 2353 patients with acute psychosis (including 818 subjects with FEP) and 1707 controls for inclusion in the meta-analysis. In all studies, there was a significant increase in risk of seropositive T. gondii IgM antibodies in acute psychosis compared with controls (7.6% vs 5.7%, OR = 1.68, 95% CI = 1.23–2.27, P = .001). There was significant heterogeneity in this estimate (χ
2 = 22.05, P = .055; I
2 = 41.1%). In a sensitivity analysis, the heterogeneity remained significant after removal of each individual study. However, after removing the 2 studies with the highest seroprevalence of positive IgM antibodies in controls,22,30 the association was notably stronger (6.1% vs 2.4%, OR = 2.81, 95% CI = 1.80–4.37, P < .001) and the heterogeneity was no longer statistically significant (χ
2 = 15.82, P = .148; I
2 = 30.5%).

In studies of acute psychosis in the context of chronic schizophrenia, the association with T. gondii IgM antibodies was stronger (8.7% vs 4.6%, OR = 2.54, 95% CI = 1.63–3.96, P < .001), but there was significant heterogeneity in this estimate (χ
2 = 15.52, P = .050; I
2 = 48.5%). In a sensitivity analysis, the association was notably stronger (6.5% vs 0.9%, OR = 6.89, 95% CI = 3.10–15.34, P < .001) and the heterogeneity was no longer statistically significant (χ
2 = 9.30, P = .232; I
2 = 24.8%) after excluding one study.22 In studies of FEP, there was a nonsignificant increase in T. gondii IgM antibodies compared with controls (5.7% vs 4.6%, OR = 1.47, 95% CI = 0.84–2.58, P = .181) and the heterogeneity was not significant (χ
2 = 3.19, P = .363; I
2 = 5.9%). Forest plots for the meta-analyses are presented as figure 2.

A funnel plot display for data derived from all studies included in the meta-analysis (figure 2) and results of Egger’s test (intercept = 1.04, 95% CI = −0.33 to 2.41, P = .118) showed no evidence for potential publication bias. In meta-regression analyses, age, sex, latitude and longitude, and year of publication were all unrelated to the association between T. gondii IgM antibodies and acute psychosis (P > .05 for each), meaning they were not associated with T. gondii IgM seropositivity. However, there was a significant association with geographic region (slope = −0.41, 95% CI = −0.80 to −0.01, P = .044), with a stronger association in studies from Asia, Europe, and South America (regions with a lower prevalence of T. gondii IgM positive controls), than in studies from Africa and the Middle East (figure 3).

Discussion

The present study consisted of a meta-analytic review of the association between T. gondii IgM antibodies and acute psychosis in patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls. We found a significant, 1.7-fold increased risk of T. gondii IgM antibodies in subjects with acute psychosis, of whom 7.6% were seropositive. This association was not moderated by age, sex, or year of publication. However, the association was moderated by geographic region, with greater effect sizes in studies from Asia, Europe, and South America.

An important strength of our study is that we considered T. gondii IgM antibodies, whereas previous studies have focused primarily on T. gondii IgG antibodies, which are a marker of lifetime exposure to toxoplasmosis.12
T. gondii IgM antibodies could represent either an acute/recent infection,13 or also potentially persistent infection or reinfection, possibly with a different genotype.14–18 Thus, our work complements and extends previous findings, raising the possibility that exposure to T. gondii is not only an important risk factor for schizophrenia, but may also be associated with relapse in schizophrenia. Another strength of the present study is that we performed meta-regression analyses to consider moderating effects of age, sex, geography, and publication year. Previous studies have found a prevalence of T. gondii IgM antibodies of 0.3% in healthy blood donors from Taiwan,57 1.6% in Italian women of childbearing age,58 2.1% in a general population sample in Mexico,59 2.4% among blood donors from the Czech Republic,60 and 4.6% among healthy volunteers in Nigeria,61 all of which are lower than the 5.7% prevalence in controls included in this meta-analysis, which raises the possibility of selection bias. However, the higher prevalence of T. gondii IgM antibodies in our controls would bias the OR toward the null hypothesis of no association with acute psychosis. Furthermore, the 2 studies removed in the sensitivity analysis also had the highest prevalence of subjects (both patients and controls) with T. gondii IgM antibodies. When these 2 studies were removed, the prevalence of T. gondii IgM antibodies in controls decreased to 2.4%, which is comparable with other general population studies cited above. Thus, although this approach could increase the OR by decreasing the prevalence of T. gondii IgM antibodies in controls, the statistical significance in both analyses points to an association that is not the result of bias.

In a post-hoc analysis, we considered the effect of dropping the 3 studies where no subjects had positive T. gondii IgM antibodies. We calculated the prevalence of positive T. gondii IgM antibodies, using absolute numbers rather than calculating ORs and 95% CIs for individual studies, with these 3 studies included. We then calculated an overall OR and 95% CI for the prevalence of positive T. gondii IgM in patients with acute psychosis vs controls. In all studies, the significant increase in risk of seropositive T. gondii IgM antibodies in acute psychosis compared with controls remained (6.6% vs 5.0%, OR = 1.34, 95% CI = 1.02–1.75, P = .035). Furthermore, in studies of acute psychosis in the context of chronic schizophrenia, the significant association with T. gondii IgM antibodies also remained (6.8% vs 3.8%, OR = 1.85, 95% CI = 1.28–2.68, P = .001). We also note that all 3 studies with no positive T. gondii IgM subjects were from Turkey. Two other included studies from Turkey had a very low prevalence of positive T. gondii IgM in patients (2.1%, 3 of 140) and controls (1.1%, 1 of 87), suggesting a region-specific effect. These findings support the robustness of the overall association.

We also performed subgroup analyses, comparing chronic schizophrenia and FEP separately. We found a significant association between acute psychosis and acute/recent toxoplasmosis in chronic schizophrenia, but a nonsignificantly increased risk in FEP. One possible explanation for this finding is that our study lacked sufficient statistical power to detect an association in FEP, as the sample size for FEP was approximately half that for chronic schizophrenia. Post-hoc calculations revealed that a total sample of 4078 subjects (2039 patients and controls) would be required to have 80% power to detect a minimum OR of 1.47, assuming a 4.6% prevalence of positive T. gondii IgM in controls. Alternatively, it is possible that the association with T. gondii IgM exists for relapse of chronic schizophrenia, but not FEP. Although the association was not moderated by age, it is possible that subjects with a longer duration of psychotic illness could have greater exposure to infectious agents than subjects with FEP due to illness-related factors.

There are several limitations of the present study. Only a subset of published studies on T.
gondii and schizophrenia met the inclusion criteria. Many excluded studies measured T. gondii IgG, but not IgM antibodies. Included studies may have used different assay methodologies and “cut-off points” for determining IgM positivity, but corresponding data were not presented. Data on the IgG status of patients seropositive for IgM antibodies were generally not available, which could inform on whether IgM positivity represents acute/recent infection, persistent infection, or reactivation of a latent infection. Data were also not available to confirm whether subjects with positive T. gondii IgM antibodies had clinical signs and/or symptoms of acute infection. Several other studies that measured IgM antibodies were excluded because data were not reported as the prevalence of IgM-positive subjects. Although our findings are subject to a potential selection bias, we attempted to mitigate this effect by contacting study authors to either clarify information or to request summary data to facilitate comparison with other studies. Another limitation is that we were not able to control for other potential confounding factors such as the uniformity of diagnoses across studies, definitions of relapse and first episode, duration of illness, number of lifetime episodes of acute psychosis (and whether or not prior episodes were associated with T. gondii), the duration of clinical stability prior to acute psychosis, exposure to cats, consumption of raw or undercooked meats, and antipsychotic medications. The impact of these factors on the association remains unclear. Although the association was moderated by geographic region, 9 of the 16 studies (56%) were performed in the Middle East, with no more than 2 studies in any other geographic region, including no studies in North America. Both geography62 and latitude63 may be associated with seroprevalence of T. gondii. Latitudinal variability may be due to local rainy conditions (oocysts live longer in more humid conditions) and low altitude regions. Factors contributing to geographic variability may include exposure to cats and/or consumption of raw or undercooked meat. There is also evidence for different T. gondii serotypes based on geography, including serotype II in Europe and of serotypes I and III in South America.64


It is not clear whether this association is specific to acute psychosis or to schizophrenia in general. We identified only one study that measured T. gondii IgM antibodies in stable patients with schizophrenia,44 but the prevalence of positive antibodies was zero in both patient and control groups. While this finding could support an association that is specific to acute psychosis, it may also be due to a relatively small sample size, selection factors, or geographic factors. In addition, data on the seroprevalence of other comorbid infections, and factors that may have provoked the onset of acute psychosis, would permit a more comprehensive assessment of the potential for confounding and of other infections on these relapses.

Our study also does not permit inferences regarding either temporal or causal aspects of this association. IgM antibodies can remain positive for months to 2 years after acute toxoplasmosis, and can also reemerge following reactivation of latent infection; thus, the timing of exposure relative to the episode of acute psychosis is unclear. One possibility is that acute psychosis, and the concurrent stress, could either increase vulnerability to exposure to toxoplasmosis (eg, a patient with disorganized behavior might be more likely to consume raw or undercooked meat), or cause a reactivation of latent infection. By contrast, it is possible that T. gondii infection precedes acute psychosis. A previous meta-analysis found an increased risk of T. gondii IgG antibodies in schizophrenia, suggesting that exposure often precedes illness onset.12 Several other studies have reported associations between acute/recent infections and acute psychosis. We have replicated an association between UTI and acute psychosis in patients with schizophrenia.65,66 In one of these studies, there was a significant association with UTI among acutely ill inpatients, but not stable outpatients with schizophrenia compared with controls.65 Srikanth et al67 found that 29% of 35 patients with acute psychosis had a definite, ongoing viral infection (including cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus type 1, mumps, measles, and Japanese encephalitis virus) in parallel with their clinical syndrome, based on diagnostic (ie, 4-fold) changes in paired antibody titers. Fellerhoff et al68 found a 9.4-fold increased risk of chlamydial infection in 72 patients hospitalized for schizophrenia compared with 225 controls (40.3% vs 6.7%). Ahokas et al.69 found that 37% of 54 acutely ill psychiatric patients had evidence of viral infection in parallel with acute psychiatric symptoms, also based on diagnostic changes in paired antibody titers. Although diagnosis information was not available for this study, it is reasonable to assume many of these patients were experiencing acute psychosis. Krause et al25 found a 9.7% prevalence of cytomegalovirus IgM antibodies among 31 inpatients with schizophrenia, vs 0% in 30 healthy controls. Given associations between different infectious exposures, these findings suggest that a rigorously designed longitudinal study is warranted to investigate issues of causality and temporality regarding associations with acute psychosis.

The association between T. gondii IgM and acute psychosis also warrants replication in other samples from diverse geographic regions. Most importantly, in order to further understand and clarify the biological relevance of this association, longitudinal studies are needed, with serial measurement of both anti-T.
gondii IgM and IgG antibody titers in relation to the clinical course of schizophrenia. Future studies should investigate this association in stable outpatients with schizophrenia, to evaluate whether it is more specific to episodes of illness relapse or schizophrenia in general. Replicated findings in well-controlled studies would suggest adjunctive treatment with antitoxoplasmosis agents might be a novel therapeutic strategy in antibody-positive patients. Given that several different acute infections may be increased in patients with acute psychosis in the context of schizophrenia, this association could also be explored with other common infections, such as cellulitis and pneumonia. Taken together, acute/recent infections appear increasingly relevant to the psychotic relapse in some patients with schizophrenia.

Introduction: A number of different infections are associated with acute psychosis. However, relationships between infections and acute psychosis in patients with schizophrenia have not been extensively explored. Exposure to Toxoplasma gondii is a replicated risk factor for schizophrenia. Previous studies have focused on T. gondii IgG antibodies, which are a marker of lifetime exposure, whereas IgM antibodies are a marker of acute/recent exposure, persistent infection, or reinfection. We performed a meta-analysis of T. gondii IgM antibodies and acute psychosis, to further investigate whether infections may be associated with relapse in schizophrenia. Methods: We identified articles by systematic searches of PubMed, PsycINFO, and ISI databases. We included studies, in English, of serum T. gondii IgM antibodies in patients with acute psychosis and controls. Results: Sixteen independent samples (2353 patients and 1707 controls) met inclusion criteria. Data were pooled using a random effects model. There was a significant increase in risk of positive T. gondii IgM antibodies in acute psychosis compared with controls (7.6% vs 5.7%, OR = 1.68, 95% CI = 1.23–2.27, P = .001). The association was stronger for patients with chronic schizophrenia (8.7% vs 4.6%, OR = 2.54, 95% CI = 1.63–3.96, P < .001) than first-episode psychosis. In meta-regression analyses, age, sex, and publication year were unrelated to the association; however, there was a significant association with geographic region. Discussion: An increased seroprevalence of T. gondii IgM in patients with acute psychosis complements and extends previous findings, suggesting that infections may be relevant to the etiopathophysiology of relapse in some patients with schizophrenia.

Schizophrenia is associated with increased infections across the lifespan. Prenatal maternal infection, with a variety of different infectious agents, is a replicated risk factor for schizophrenia1 and may act synergistically with family history of psychosis.2 Hospital contact for infection during childhood or adolescence is associated with an increased risk of schizophrenia.3 Schizophrenia is also associated with increased mortality from infectious diseases, including pneumonia and influenza.4,5 Outside of schizophrenia, a number of different viral, bacterial, and parasitic infections are associated with acute psychosis, a notable example being geriatric patients with psychosis and a comorbid urinary tract infection (UTI) in the context of either dementia or delirium.6,7 However, relationships between infections and acute psychosis in patients with schizophrenia have not been extensively explored.

Acute psychosis is common and relapse prevention represents an important treatment issue in schizophrenia. Robinson et al8 found that 82% of patients with first-episode psychosis (FEP) had an illness relapse within 5 years after recovery, and a majority had multiple relapses. Illness relapse is associated with adverse outcomes, including increased treatment-resistant symptoms, cognitive decline, and functional disability.9–11 Thus, to better understand and predict relapse in schizophrenia is a compelling opportunity and public health priority.

Exposure to Toxoplasma gondii is a robust risk factor for schizophrenia. A meta-analysis found that subjects with FEP have a 2.5-fold increased risk of lifetime infection compared with controls, and a similar 2.7-fold increased risk of lifetime infection across all clinical phases of schizophrenia.12 Most previous studies have focused on T. gondii IgG antibodies, which are a marker of lifetime exposure to toxoplasmosis, whereas IgM antibodies are a marker of acute/recent infection,13 or also potentially persistent infection or reinfection, possibly with a different genotype.14–18 The objective of this study was to perform a meta-analysis of the association between T. gondii IgM antibodies and acute psychosis in schizophrenia, to further investigate whether infections may be associated with relapse in schizophrenia. We hypothesize that there is an increased seroprevalence of T. gondii antibodies in patients with acute psychosis compared with controls.

After independent searches, detailed review of study methods by 2 authors (J.M.M. and B.J.M.) and attempts to contact study authors, 16 studies met the inclusion criteria, with 4 studies of FEP, 10 studies of chronic schizophrenia, and 2 studies of both FEP and chronic schizophrenia (15–30). Twelve studies were excluded from the final analysis due to: data on the prevalence of positive IgM antibodies not available (n = 5), uncertainty if patients were experiencing acute psychosis (n = 3), no control group (n = 2), patients not experiencing acute psychosis (n = 1), and significant overlap in study population (n = 1). There was universal agreement on the included studies. A flowchart summarizing the study selection process is presented in figure 1.

Flowchart of the study selection process.

Data were extracted for sample size and number of subjects seropositive for T. gondii IgM antibodies for acute psychosis and controls in each study. We also extracted descriptive data on geographic location, assay method, age, and sex. One author (B.J.M.) extracted all data, which was independently verified by another author (J.M.M.). Effect size estimates (ORs and 95% CIs) were aggregated utilizing the random effects method of DerSimonian and Laird.47 Random effects methods are considered to be more representative of real-world data in comparison to the alternative fixed effect approach48 and provide a more conservative estimate of the average weighted effect size.49 Random effects models also yield their actual first error rate while fixed effect models tend to inflate their first error rate. CIs obtained by fixed effect models are also biased and their actual coverage rate is smaller than their nominal coverage rate.50 Three studies that otherwise met the inclusion criteria could not be analyzed in the random effects meta-analysis because the prevalence of T. gondii IgM antibodies was zero for both acute psychosis and control groups, which results in an OR and 95% CI that is undefined.23,29,32 The main statistical hypothesis was that the ORs for the seroprevalence of T. gondii IgM in patients with acute psychosis vs controls equals 1.00. In a secondary analysis, we repeated the meta-analysis procedure for studies of FEP and chronic schizophrenia (each vs controls) considered separately.

The meta-analysis procedure also calculates a χ
2 value for the heterogeneity in effect size estimates, which is based on Cochran’s Q-statistic,51 and I
2, the proportion of the variation in effect size attributable to between-study heterogeneity. Between-study heterogeneity χ
2 was considered significant for P < .10.52 For all studies, and studies of chronic schizophrenia, between-study heterogeneity χ
2 was significant, so we performed a sensitivity analysis. This was done by removing one study at a time and repeating the meta-analysis procedure, to examine its impact on the OR and between-study heterogeneity.53 Given the significant heterogeneity in the overall result, we also performed a series of meta-regressions to explore possible moderating variables to account for such heterogeneity. Meta-regression assesses and adjusts the effects of potential moderating variables on the effect size estimate from the meta-analysis (much in the same way that regression assesses the relationships between moderating variables and a dependent variable). A positive slope (ie, regression coefficient) means that the effect size estimate from the meta-analysis and the moderator variable change in the same direction, and a negative slope means they change in the opposite direction. We conducted meta-regression analyses of age, sex, geographic location (latitude and longitude, considered separately, as well as region), and year of publication. As 14 of the 16 studies measured T. gondii IgM using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, we did not perform a meta-regression with assay method. Potential for publication bias was examined by means of Sterne’s funnel plot analysis54 and Egger’s regression intercept.55 The statistical analyses were performed in Stata 10.0 (StataCorp LP).56 All tests were 2-sided, and P values were considered statistically significant at the α = .05 level.

As described in table 1, search procedures yielded 16 independent studies, comprising 2353 patients with acute psychosis (including 818 subjects with FEP) and 1707 controls for inclusion in the meta-analysis. In all studies, there was a significant increase in risk of seropositive T. gondii IgM antibodies in acute psychosis compared with controls (7.6% vs 5.7%, OR = 1.68, 95% CI = 1.23–2.27, P = .001). There was significant heterogeneity in this estimate (χ
2 = 22.05, P = .055; I
2 = 41.1%). In a sensitivity analysis, the heterogeneity remained significant after removal of each individual study. However, after removing the 2 studies with the highest seroprevalence of positive IgM antibodies in controls,22,30 the association was notably stronger (6.1% vs 2.4%, OR = 2.81, 95% CI = 1.80–4.37, P < .001) and the heterogeneity was no longer statistically significant (χ
2 = 15.82, P = .148; I
2 = 30.5%).

In studies of acute psychosis in the context of chronic schizophrenia, the association with T. gondii IgM antibodies was stronger (8.7% vs 4.6%, OR = 2.54, 95% CI = 1.63–3.96, P < .001), but there was significant heterogeneity in this estimate (χ
2 = 15.52, P = .050; I
2 = 48.5%). In a sensitivity analysis, the association was notably stronger (6.5% vs 0.9%, OR = 6.89, 95% CI = 3.10–15.34, P < .001) and the heterogeneity was no longer statistically significant (χ
2 = 9.30, P = .232; I
2 = 24.8%) after excluding one study.22 In studies of FEP, there was a nonsignificant increase in T. gondii IgM antibodies compared with controls (5.7% vs 4.6%, OR = 1.47, 95% CI = 0.84–2.58, P = .181) and the heterogeneity was not significant (χ
2 = 3.19, P = .363; I
2 = 5.9%). Forest plots for the meta-analyses are presented as figure 2.

Meta-analysis of Anti-Toxoplasma gondii IgM antibodies.

A funnel plot display for data derived from all studies included in the meta-analysis (figure 2) and results of Egger’s test (intercept = 1.04, 95% CI = −0.33 to 2.41, P = .118) showed no evidence for potential publication bias. In meta-regression analyses, age, sex, latitude and longitude, and year of publication were all unrelated to the association between T. gondii IgM antibodies and acute psychosis (P > .05 for each), meaning they were not associated with T. gondii IgM seropositivity. However, there was a significant association with geographic region (slope = −0.41, 95% CI = −0.80 to −0.01, P = .044), with a stronger association in studies from Asia, Europe, and South America (regions with a lower prevalence of T. gondii IgM positive controls), than in studies from Africa and the Middle East (figure 3).

Meta-regression analysis of the effects of geographic region on the association between anti-Toxoplasma gondii IgM and acute psychosis.

The present study consisted of a meta-analytic review of the association between T. gondii IgM antibodies and acute psychosis in patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls. We found a significant, 1.7-fold increased risk of T. gondii IgM antibodies in subjects with acute psychosis, of whom 7.6% were seropositive. This association was not moderated by age, sex, or year of publication. However, the association was moderated by geographic region, with greater effect sizes in studies from Asia, Europe, and South America.

An important strength of our study is that we considered T. gondii IgM antibodies, whereas previous studies have focused primarily on T. gondii IgG antibodies, which are a marker of lifetime exposure to toxoplasmosis.12
T. gondii IgM antibodies could represent either an acute/recent infection,13 or also potentially persistent infection or reinfection, possibly with a different genotype.14–18 Thus, our work complements and extends previous findings, raising the possibility that exposure to T. gondii is not only an important risk factor for schizophrenia, but may also be associated with relapse in schizophrenia. Another strength of the present study is that we performed meta-regression analyses to consider moderating effects of age, sex, geography, and publication year. Previous studies have found a prevalence of T. gondii IgM antibodies of 0.3% in healthy blood donors from Taiwan,57 1.6% in Italian women of childbearing age,58 2.1% in a general population sample in Mexico,59 2.4% among blood donors from the Czech Republic,60 and 4.6% among healthy volunteers in Nigeria,61 all of which are lower than the 5.7% prevalence in controls included in this meta-analysis, which raises the possibility of selection bias. However, the higher prevalence of T. gondii IgM antibodies in our controls would bias the OR toward the null hypothesis of no association with acute psychosis. Furthermore, the 2 studies removed in the sensitivity analysis also had the highest prevalence of subjects (both patients and controls) with T. gondii IgM antibodies. When these 2 studies were removed, the prevalence of T. gondii IgM antibodies in controls decreased to 2.4%, which is comparable with other general population studies cited above. Thus, although this approach could increase the OR by decreasing the prevalence of T. gondii IgM antibodies in controls, the statistical significance in both analyses points to an association that is not the result of bias.

In a post-hoc analysis, we considered the effect of dropping the 3 studies where no subjects had positive T. gondii IgM antibodies. We calculated the prevalence of positive T. gondii IgM antibodies, using absolute numbers rather than calculating ORs and 95% CIs for individual studies, with these 3 studies included. We then calculated an overall OR and 95% CI for the prevalence of positive T. gondii IgM in patients with acute psychosis vs controls. In all studies, the significant increase in risk of seropositive T. gondii IgM antibodies in acute psychosis compared with controls remained (6.6% vs 5.0%, OR = 1.34, 95% CI = 1.02–1.75, P = .035). Furthermore, in studies of acute psychosis in the context of chronic schizophrenia, the significant association with T. gondii IgM antibodies also remained (6.8% vs 3.8%, OR = 1.85, 95% CI = 1.28–2.68, P = .001). We also note that all 3 studies with no positive T. gondii IgM subjects were from Turkey. Two other included studies from Turkey had a very low prevalence of positive T. gondii IgM in patients (2.1%, 3 of 140) and controls (1.1%, 1 of 87), suggesting a region-specific effect. These findings support the robustness of the overall association.

We also performed subgroup analyses, comparing chronic schizophrenia and FEP separately. We found a significant association between acute psychosis and acute/recent toxoplasmosis in chronic schizophrenia, but a nonsignificantly increased risk in FEP. One possible explanation for this finding is that our study lacked sufficient statistical power to detect an association in FEP, as the sample size for FEP was approximately half that for chronic schizophrenia. Post-hoc calculations revealed that a total sample of 4078 subjects (2039 patients and controls) would be required to have 80% power to detect a minimum OR of 1.47, assuming a 4.6% prevalence of positive T. gondii IgM in controls. Alternatively, it is possible that the association with T. gondii IgM exists for relapse of chronic schizophrenia, but not FEP. Although the association was not moderated by age, it is possible that subjects with a longer duration of psychotic illness could have greater exposure to infectious agents than subjects with FEP due to illness-related factors.

There are several limitations of the present study. Only a subset of published studies on T.
gondii and schizophrenia met the inclusion criteria. Many excluded studies measured T. gondii IgG, but not IgM antibodies. Included studies may have used different assay methodologies and “cut-off points” for determining IgM positivity, but corresponding data were not presented. Data on the IgG status of patients seropositive for IgM antibodies were generally not available, which could inform on whether IgM positivity represents acute/recent infection, persistent infection, or reactivation of a latent infection. Data were also not available to confirm whether subjects with positive T. gondii IgM antibodies had clinical signs and/or symptoms of acute infection. Several other studies that measured IgM antibodies were excluded because data were not reported as the prevalence of IgM-positive subjects. Although our findings are subject to a potential selection bias, we attempted to mitigate this effect by contacting study authors to either clarify information or to request summary data to facilitate comparison with other studies. Another limitation is that we were not able to control for other potential confounding factors such as the uniformity of diagnoses across studies, definitions of relapse and first episode, duration of illness, number of lifetime episodes of acute psychosis (and whether or not prior episodes were associated with T. gondii), the duration of clinical stability prior to acute psychosis, exposure to cats, consumption of raw or undercooked meats, and antipsychotic medications. The impact of these factors on the association remains unclear. Although the association was moderated by geographic region, 9 of the 16 studies (56%) were performed in the Middle East, with no more than 2 studies in any other geographic region, including no studies in North America. Both geography62 and latitude63 may be associated with seroprevalence of T. gondii. Latitudinal variability may be due to local rainy conditions (oocysts live longer in more humid conditions) and low altitude regions. Factors contributing to geographic variability may include exposure to cats and/or consumption of raw or undercooked meat. There is also evidence for different T. gondii serotypes based on geography, including serotype II in Europe and of serotypes I and III in South America.64


It is not clear whether this association is specific to acute psychosis or to schizophrenia in general. We identified only one study that measured T. gondii IgM antibodies in stable patients with schizophrenia,44 but the prevalence of positive antibodies was zero in both patient and control groups. While this finding could support an association that is specific to acute psychosis, it may also be due to a relatively small sample size, selection factors, or geographic factors. In addition, data on the seroprevalence of other comorbid infections, and factors that may have provoked the onset of acute psychosis, would permit a more comprehensive assessment of the potential for confounding and of other infections on these relapses.

Our study also does not permit inferences regarding either temporal or causal aspects of this association. IgM antibodies can remain positive for months to 2 years after acute toxoplasmosis, and can also reemerge following reactivation of latent infection; thus, the timing of exposure relative to the episode of acute psychosis is unclear. One possibility is that acute psychosis, and the concurrent stress, could either increase vulnerability to exposure to toxoplasmosis (eg, a patient with disorganized behavior might be more likely to consume raw or undercooked meat), or cause a reactivation of latent infection. By contrast, it is possible that T. gondii infection precedes acute psychosis. A previous meta-analysis found an increased risk of T. gondii IgG antibodies in schizophrenia, suggesting that exposure often precedes illness onset.12 Several other studies have reported associations between acute/recent infections and acute psychosis. We have replicated an association between UTI and acute psychosis in patients with schizophrenia.65,66 In one of these studies, there was a significant association with UTI among acutely ill inpatients, but not stable outpatients with schizophrenia compared with controls.65 Srikanth et al67 found that 29% of 35 patients with acute psychosis had a definite, ongoing viral infection (including cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus type 1, mumps, measles, and Japanese encephalitis virus) in parallel with their clinical syndrome, based on diagnostic (ie, 4-fold) changes in paired antibody titers. Fellerhoff et al68 found a 9.4-fold increased risk of chlamydial infection in 72 patients hospitalized for schizophrenia compared with 225 controls (40.3% vs 6.7%). Ahokas et al.69 found that 37% of 54 acutely ill psychiatric patients had evidence of viral infection in parallel with acute psychiatric symptoms, also based on diagnostic changes in paired antibody titers. Although diagnosis information was not available for this study, it is reasonable to assume many of these patients were experiencing acute psychosis. Krause et al25 found a 9.7% prevalence of cytomegalovirus IgM antibodies among 31 inpatients with schizophrenia, vs 0% in 30 healthy controls. Given associations between different infectious exposures, these findings suggest that a rigorously designed longitudinal study is warranted to investigate issues of causality and temporality regarding associations with acute psychosis.

The association between T. gondii IgM and acute psychosis also warrants replication in other samples from diverse geographic regions. Most importantly, in order to further understand and clarify the biological relevance of this association, longitudinal studies are needed, with serial measurement of both anti-T.
gondii IgM and IgG antibody titers in relation to the clinical course of schizophrenia. Future studies should investigate this association in stable outpatients with schizophrenia, to evaluate whether it is more specific to episodes of illness relapse or schizophrenia in general. Replicated findings in well-controlled studies would suggest adjunctive treatment with antitoxoplasmosis agents might be a novel therapeutic strategy in antibody-positive patients. Given that several different acute infections may be increased in patients with acute psychosis in the context of schizophrenia, this association could also be explored with other common infections, such as cellulitis and pneumonia. Taken together, acute/recent infections appear increasingly relevant to the psychotic relapse in some patients with schizophrenia.

Introduction: A number of different infections are associated with acute psychosis. However, relationships between infections and acute psychosis in patients with schizophrenia have not been extensively explored. Exposure to Toxoplasma gondii is a replicated risk factor for schizophrenia. Previous studies have focused on T. gondii IgG antibodies, which are a marker of lifetime exposure, whereas IgM antibodies are a marker of acute/recent exposure, persistent infection, or reinfection. We performed a meta-analysis of T. gondii IgM antibodies and acute psychosis, to further investigate whether infections may be associated with relapse in schizophrenia. Methods: We identified articles by systematic searches of PubMed, PsycINFO, and ISI databases. We included studies, in English, of serum T. gondii IgM antibodies in patients with acute psychosis and controls. Results: Sixteen independent samples (2353 patients and 1707 controls) met inclusion criteria. Data were pooled using a random effects model. There was a significant increase in risk of positive T. gondii IgM antibodies in acute psychosis compared with controls (7.6% vs 5.7%, OR = 1.68, 95% CI = 1.23–2.27, P = .001). The association was stronger for patients with chronic schizophrenia (8.7% vs 4.6%, OR = 2.54, 95% CI = 1.63–3.96, P < .001) than first-episode psychosis. In meta-regression analyses, age, sex, and publication year were unrelated to the association; however, there was a significant association with geographic region. Discussion: An increased seroprevalence of T. gondii IgM in patients with acute psychosis complements and extends previous findings, suggesting that infections may be relevant to the etiopathophysiology of relapse in some patients with schizophrenia.

Schizophrenia is associated with increased infections across the lifespan. Prenatal maternal infection, with a variety of different infectious agents, is a replicated risk factor for schizophrenia1 and may act synergistically with family history of psychosis.2 Hospital contact for infection during childhood or adolescence is associated with an increased risk of schizophrenia.3 Schizophrenia is also associated with increased mortality from infectious diseases, including pneumonia and influenza.4,5 Outside of schizophrenia, a number of different viral, bacterial, and parasitic infections are associated with acute psychosis, a notable example being geriatric patients with psychosis and a comorbid urinary tract infection (UTI) in the context of either dementia or delirium.6,7 However, relationships between infections and acute psychosis in patients with schizophrenia have not been extensively explored.

Acute psychosis is common and relapse prevention represents an important treatment issue in schizophrenia. Robinson et al8 found that 82% of patients with first-episode psychosis (FEP) had an illness relapse within 5 years after recovery, and a majority had multiple relapses. Illness relapse is associated with adverse outcomes, including increased treatment-resistant symptoms, cognitive decline, and functional disability.9–11 Thus, to better understand and predict relapse in schizophrenia is a compelling opportunity and public health priority.

Exposure to Toxoplasma gondii is a robust risk factor for schizophrenia. A meta-analysis found that subjects with FEP have a 2.5-fold increased risk of lifetime infection compared with controls, and a similar 2.7-fold increased risk of lifetime infection across all clinical phases of schizophrenia.12 Most previous studies have focused on T. gondii IgG antibodies, which are a marker of lifetime exposure to toxoplasmosis, whereas IgM antibodies are a marker of acute/recent infection,13 or also potentially persistent infection or reinfection, possibly with a different genotype.14–18 The objective of this study was to perform a meta-analysis of the association between T. gondii IgM antibodies and acute psychosis in schizophrenia, to further investigate whether infections may be associated with relapse in schizophrenia. We hypothesize that there is an increased seroprevalence of T. gondii antibodies in patients with acute psychosis compared with controls.

Studies of T. gondii IgM antibodies in schizophrenia were systematically searched using Medline (PubMed, National Center for Biotechnology Information, US National Library of Medicine, Bethesda, MD), PsycINFO (via Ovid, American Psychological Association, Washington, DC), and Thomson Reuters (formerly ISI) Web of Knowledge (Science Citation Index and Social Sciences Citation Index, Thomson Reuters, Charlottesville, VA) from 1953 (when the first known study of T. gondii antibodies in patients with psychosis was published) through October 26, 2013, when the final search procedure was conducted. The primary search strategy was “(toxoplasma OR toxoplasmosis) AND (psychosis OR schizophrenia),” which yielded 160 articles from PubMed, 78 for PsycINFO, and 251 for ISI. Titles and abstracts of the resulting matches were screened for relevance to the present meta-analysis. The inclusion criteria were (1) case-control studies of serum T. gondii IgM antibodies in patients with acute psychosis in the context of schizophrenia or related psychotic spectrum disorders (including schizophreniform disorder, brief psychotic disorder, psychotic disorder not otherwise specified, delusional disorder, and schizoaffective disorder) and healthy controls, (2) the study had to be published, and (3) studies or abstracts had to be written in English. Patients with acute psychosis were further stratified by FEP or chronic schizophrenia. For studies that included patients with both FEP and chronic schizophrenia, if stratified data were not presented in the manuscript, we attempted to contact study authors. The exclusion criteria were: (1) studies that measured T. gondii IgG, but not IgM antibodies, (2) studies without a control group, (3) significant overlap in study population, (4) studies that assayed prenatal or antenatal samples, (5) studies of subjects at clinical high risk for psychosis, (6) studies of subjects with affective psychosis, and (7) review articles without primary data. For studies that measured both anti-T.
gondii IgG and IgM antibodies, if stratified data were not presented in the manuscript, we attempted to contact study authors.

From these sources, as well as a hand-searched review of reference lists, we identified 116 studies for potential inclusion. We did not employ formal search software and all publications were retrieved and examined in full text. Based on a preliminary review of these matches, 28 studies presented data on T. gondii IgM antibodies and warranted further consideration.19–46 These studies are summarized in table 1. The majority of initial matches were excluded because they did not present data on T. gondii IgM antibodies or were review articles. After independent searches, detailed review of study methods by 2 authors (J.M.M. and B.J.M.) and attempts to contact study authors, 16 studies met the inclusion criteria, with 4 studies of FEP, 10 studies of chronic schizophrenia, and 2 studies of both FEP and chronic schizophrenia (15–30). Twelve studies were excluded from the final analysis due to: data on the prevalence of positive IgM antibodies not available (n = 5), uncertainty if patients were experiencing acute psychosis (n = 3), no control group (n = 2), patients not experiencing acute psychosis (n = 1), and significant overlap in study population (n = 1). There was universal agreement on the included studies. A flowchart summarizing the study selection process is presented in figure 1.

The present study consisted of a meta-analytic review of the association between T. gondii IgM antibodies and acute psychosis in patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls. We found a significant, 1.7-fold increased risk of T. gondii IgM antibodies in subjects with acute psychosis, of whom 7.6% were seropositive.

Another strength of the present study is that we performed meta-regression analyses to consider moderating effects of age, sex, geography, and publication year. Previous studies have found a prevalence of T. gondii IgM antibodies of 0.3% in healthy blood donors from Taiwan,57 1.6% in Italian women of childbearing age,58 2.1% in a general population sample in Mexico,59 2.4% among blood donors from the Czech Republic,60 and 4.6% among healthy volunteers in Nigeria,61 all of which are lower than the 5.7% prevalence in controls included in this meta-analysis, which raises the possibility of selection bias. However, the higher prevalence of T. gondii IgM antibodies in our controls would bias the OR toward the null hypothesis of no association with acute psychosis. Furthermore, the 2 studies removed in the sensitivity analysis also had the highest prevalence of subjects (both patients and controls) with T. gondii IgM antibodies. When these 2 studies were removed, the prevalence of T. gondii IgM antibodies in controls decreased to 2.4%, which is comparable with other general population studies cited above. Thus, although this approach could increase the OR by decreasing the prevalence of T. gondii IgM antibodies in controls, the statistical significance in both analyses points to an association that is not the result of bias.

In a post-hoc analysis, we considered the effect of dropping the 3 studies where no subjects had positive T. gondii IgM antibodies. We calculated the prevalence of positive T. gondii IgM antibodies, using absolute numbers rather than calculating ORs and 95% CIs for individual studies, with these 3 studies included. We then calculated an overall OR and 95% CI for the prevalence of positive T. gondii IgM in patients with acute psychosis vs controls. In all studies, the significant increase in risk of seropositive T. gondii IgM antibodies in acute psychosis compared with controls remained (6.6% vs 5.0%, OR = 1.34, 95% CI = 1.02–1.75, P = .035). Furthermore, in studies of acute psychosis in the context of chronic schizophrenia, the significant association with T. gondii IgM antibodies also remained (6.8% vs 3.8%, OR = 1.85, 95% CI = 1.28–2.68, P = .001). We also note that all 3 studies with no positive T. gondii IgM subjects were from Turkey. Two other included studies from Turkey had a very low prevalence of positive T. gondii IgM in patients (2.1%, 3 of 140) and controls (1.1%, 1 of 87), suggesting a region-specific effect. These findings support the robustness of the overall association.

We also performed subgroup analyses, comparing chronic schizophrenia and FEP separately. We found a significant association between acute psychosis and acute/recent toxoplasmosis in chronic schizophrenia, but a nonsignificantly increased risk in FEP. One possible explanation for this finding is that our study lacked sufficient statistical power to detect an association in FEP, as the sample size for FEP was approximately half that for chronic schizophrenia. Post-hoc calculations revealed that a total sample of 4078 subjects (2039 patients and controls) would be required to have 80% power to detect a minimum OR of 1.47, assuming a 4.6% prevalence of positive T. gondii IgM in controls. Alternatively, it is possible that the association with T. gondii IgM exists for relapse of chronic schizophrenia, but not FEP. Although the association was not moderated by age, it is possible that subjects with a longer duration of psychotic illness could have greater exposure to infectious agents than subjects with FEP due to illness-related factors.

There are several limitations of the present study. Only a subset of published studies on T.
gondii and schizophrenia met the inclusion criteria. Many excluded studies measured T. gondii IgG, but not IgM antibodies. Included studies may have used different assay methodologies and “cut-off points” for determining IgM positivity, but corresponding data were not presented. Data on the IgG status of patients seropositive for IgM antibodies were generally not available, which could inform on whether IgM positivity represents acute/recent infection, persistent infection, or reactivation of a latent infection. Data were also not available to confirm whether subjects with positive T. gondii IgM antibodies had clinical signs and/or symptoms of acute infection. Several other studies that measured IgM antibodies were excluded because data were not reported as the prevalence of IgM-positive subjects. Although our findings are subject to a potential selection bias, we attempted to mitigate this effect by contacting study authors to either clarify information or to request summary data to facilitate comparison with other studies. Another limitation is that we were not able to control for other potential confounding factors such as the uniformity of diagnoses across studies, definitions of relapse and first episode, duration of illness, number of lifetime episodes of acute psychosis (and whether or not prior episodes were associated with T. gondii), the duration of clinical stability prior to acute psychosis, exposure to cats, consumption of raw or undercooked meats, and antipsychotic medications. The impact of these factors on the association remains unclear. Although the association was moderated by geographic region, 9 of the 16 studies (56%) were performed in the Middle East, with no more than 2 studies in any other geographic region, including no studies in North America. Both geography62 and latitude63 may be associated with seroprevalence of T. gondii. Latitudinal variability may be due to local rainy conditions (oocysts live longer in more humid conditions) and low altitude regions. Factors contributing to geographic variability may include exposure to cats and/or consumption of raw or undercooked meat. There is also evidence for different T. gondii serotypes based on geography, including serotype II in Europe and of serotypes I and III in South America.64


It is not clear whether this association is specific to acute psychosis or to schizophrenia in general. We identified only one study that measured T. gondii IgM antibodies in stable patients with schizophrenia,44 but the prevalence of positive antibodies was zero in both patient and control groups. While this finding could support an association that is specific to acute psychosis, it may also be due to a relatively small sample size, selection factors, or geographic factors. In addition, data on the seroprevalence of other comorbid infections, and factors that may have provoked the onset of acute psychosis, would permit a more comprehensive assessment of the potential for confounding and of other infections on these relapses.

Our study also does not permit inferences regarding either temporal or causal aspects of this association. IgM antibodies can remain positive for months to 2 years after acute toxoplasmosis, and can also reemerge following reactivation of latent infection; thus, the timing of exposure relative to the episode of acute psychosis is unclear. One possibility is that acute psychosis, and the concurrent stress, could either increase vulnerability to exposure to toxoplasmosis (eg, a patient with disorganized behavior might be more likely to consume raw or undercooked meat), or cause a reactivation of latent infection. By contrast, it is possible that T. gondii infection precedes acute psychosis. A previous meta-analysis found an increased risk of T. gondii IgG antibodies in schizophrenia, suggesting that exposure often precedes illness onset.12 Several other studies have reported associations between acute/recent infections and acute psychosis. We have replicated an association between UTI and acute psychosis in patients with schizophrenia.65,66 In one of these studies, there was a significant association with UTI among acutely ill inpatients, but not stable outpatients with schizophrenia compared with controls.65 Srikanth et al67 found that 29% of 35 patients with acute psychosis had a definite, ongoing viral infection (including cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus type 1, mumps, measles, and Japanese encephalitis virus) in parallel with their clinical syndrome, based on diagnostic (ie, 4-fold) changes in paired antibody titers. Fellerhoff et al68 found a 9.4-fold increased risk of chlamydial infection in 72 patients hospitalized for schizophrenia compared with 225 controls (40.3% vs 6.7%). Ahokas et al.69 found that 37% of 54 acutely ill psychiatric patients had evidence of viral infection in parallel with acute psychiatric symptoms, also based on diagnostic changes in paired antibody titers. Although diagnosis information was not available for this study, it is reasonable to assume many of these patients were experiencing acute psychosis. Krause et al25 found a 9.7% prevalence of cytomegalovirus IgM antibodies among 31 inpatients with schizophrenia, vs 0% in 30 healthy controls. Given associations between different infectious exposures, these findings suggest that a rigorously designed longitudinal study is warranted to investigate issues of causality and temporality regarding associations with acute psychosis.

The association between T. gondii IgM and acute psychosis also warrants replication in other samples from diverse geographic regions. Most importantly, in order to further understand and clarify the biological relevance of this association, longitudinal studies are needed, with serial measurement of both anti-T.
gondii IgM and IgG antibody titers in relation to the clinical course of schizophrenia. Future studies should investigate this association in stable outpatients with schizophrenia, to evaluate whether it is more specific to episodes of illness relapse or schizophrenia in general. Replicated findings in well-controlled studies would suggest adjunctive treatment with antitoxoplasmosis agents might be a novel therapeutic strategy in antibody-positive patients. Given that several different acute infections may be increased in patients with acute psychosis in the context of schizophrenia, this association could also be explored with other common infections, such as cellulitis and pneumonia. Taken together, acute/recent infections appear increasingly relevant to the psychotic relapse in some patients with schizophrenia.
