## Summarization of Scientific Texts: A Rhetorical Approach

- This project is based on [Summarizing Scientific Articles: Experiments with Relevance and Rhetorical Status](https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/089120102762671936)

- The main idea behind this paper is to use a rhetorical approach for classifying different statements present in a scientific paper on basis of argumentative zoning.

- This project builds towards automatic summarisation of scientific papers. We aim to classify each sentence within the research paper as one of the 7 rhetorical categories as mentioned below.

### Annotation Based on Argumentative Zoning

Each of the statement in the paper is divided into following different categories
- **Aim** - Specific research goal of the current paper  
- **Textual** - Makes reference to the structure of the current paper    
- **Own** - (Neutral) description of own work presented in current paper: Methodology, results, discussion  
- **Background** - Generally accepted scientific background  
- **Contrast** - Statements of comparison with or contrast to other work; weaknesses of other work  
- **Basis** - Statements of agreement with other work or continuation of other work  
- **Other** - (Neutral) description of other researchersâ€™ work  

On basis of the above rhetorical categories we do the argumentative zoning of the sentences present in the papers. 

### Features of a sentence

- **Location** - Where in the document the sentence occurs  
- **Section Structure** - Where in the section does the sentence occurs, i.e. if a sentence is a first line of the section and so on.  
- **Paragraph Structure** - Whether a sentence occurs in the start, middle or the end of a paragraph.  
- **Headline**
- **Length** - Whether the given line is a long line or not.  
- **Title** - If the words in the sentence occur in the title or not.  
- **TF IDF Score** - Whether the sentence consists of significant words or not.  
- **Voice** - What is the voice of the main verb of the sentence.  
- **Tense** - Tense of the main verb or aux verb of the sentence.  
- **Modal** - Just using the above concept we find whether there is an auxiliary verb with the main verb. If yes we give the corresponding values.  


### Approaches and Tools Used
We used existing argumentative zoning dataset and on that we created different feature vectors corresponding to each sentence, and then we trained a ***Naive Bayes*** classifier on the dataset. We did a test-train split of **0.8**

We used ***NLTK*** and ***Scikit*** for writing the classifier. Since we used scikit learn we were able to test our model with multiple distributions. 

We have used ***Naive Bayes*** with the following distributions: 
- ***Bernoulli Distribution***
- ***Gaussian Distribution***
- ***Multinomial Distribution***
- ***Complement Distribution***

### Results

| Test Dataset   | ***15 ( 20 % )***      |



| Distribution      | Accuracy |
|-----------| -------------    |
| Bernoulli  | ***84.64***      |
| Gaussian   | ***100***      |
| Multinomial  | ***80.89***      |
