Studies of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs) suggest that Restricted and
Repetitive Behaviors (RRBs) are particularly difficult to remediate. We examined present
and past RRBs in 34 individuals who achieved optimal outcomes (OOs; lost their ASD
diagnosis), 45 high-functioning individuals with ASD (HFA) and 34 typically developing
(TD) peers. The OO group exhibited minimal residual RRBs at the time of the study. All OO
participants were reported to have at least one RRB in early childhood and almost 90% met
the RRB cutoff for ASD in early childhood, but RRBs were not more present in the OO than
the TD group at the time of the study. History of RRBs in the HFA and OO groups differed
only in oversensitivity to noise and insistence on sameness. Reports of current behavior
indicated that RRB’s had almost totally disappeared in the OO group. Thus, although
RRB’s were present in the OO group in childhood, they resolved along with social
and communication deficits.

Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs) are a group of neurodevelopmental disorders believed
to affect as many as one in 88 individuals (Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention [CDC], 2012). These disorders are characterized by deficits in
communication and socialization, as well as by the presence of restricted and repetitive
behaviors (RRBs). ASDs are generally considered to be lifelong disorders (American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2000). However,
several studies have indicated that a small proportion of individuals who are diagnosed with
an ASD early in childhood experience a reduction in autism symptomatology to such a degree
that they no longer meet diagnostic criteria for any ASD as they get older (Cohen, Amerine-Dickens, & Smith, 2007; Fein et al., 2013; Harris & Handleman, 2000; Howlin, Goode, Hutton, & Rutter, 2004; Kelley, Naigles, & Fein, 2010; Kelley, Paul, Fein, & Naigles, 2006; Lovaas, 1987; Rutter, Greenfield, & Lockyer,
1967; Sallows & Graupner, 2005; Seltzer, Shattuck, Abbeduto, & Greenberg, 2004; Sigman & Ruskin, 1999; Szatmari, Bartolucci, Bremner, Bond, & Rich, 1989; Venter, Lord, & Schopler, 1992; Weiss,
1999; Zachor, Ben-Itzchak, Rabinovich, & Lahat,
2007). However, most of these studies did not describe in detail the functioning of
these individuals compared to groups of individuals who still met criteria for
high-functioning ASD.

Some studies documenting such positive outcomes among individuals previously
diagnosed with ASD have suggested that these individuals continue to present with subthreshold
symptoms of ASDs (Piven, Harper, Palmer, & Arndt,
1996). This concern is supported by multiple studies that have demonstrated that core
features of ASD fluctuate with age and generally tend to lessen in severity by the time that
an individual reaches adulthood (Byrd, 2002; Eaves & Ho, 1996; Kobayashi, Murata, & Yoshinaga, 1992; Leekham, Prior, & Uljarevic, 2011;
Piven et al., 1996; Rumsey, Rapoport, & Sceery, 1985; Seltzer et
al., 2004; Shea & Mesibov, 2005). As a
result of this line of research, Seltzer and colleagues
(2004) discussed the possibility that reports of “recovery” in ASD may
reflect this general tendency for symptoms of ASD to improve with age, but argued that the
core features of ASD continue to be present in these individuals.

When considering developmental changes within the three clusters of ASD symptoms in
high-functioning individuals, symptoms within the Restricted and Repetitive Behaviors (RRBs)
cluster tend to persist into adolescence and adulthood, even while social and communication
symptoms in ASD may improve (Leekham et al., 2011; Murphy et
al., 2005; Piven et al., 1996, Seltzer et al., 2004). Some types of RRBs (e.g.,
circumscribed interests) may even increase in severity with age (Bishop, Richler, & Lord, 2006; Rutter
1978; South, Ozonoff, & McMahon, 2005).
Because symptoms within the RRBs cluster may be particularly difficult to remediate, reports
of children who lose their ASD diagnosis as they mature have raised the question of whether
RRBs may persist among these individuals.

Several studies explored the current functioning of children who were once diagnosed
with ASDs and who have achieved “optimal outcomes (OOs)” (Fein et al., 2013; Kelley et al.,
2006, 2010). These studies defined OOs as
referring to children who were diagnosed with ASDs in the preschool period and at the time of
the studies no longer met diagnostic criteria for any ASD, exhibited average IQ and were
mainstreamed into regular education classrooms without one-on-one assistance. Thus far,
studies exploring the functioning of individuals who achieve OOs have not methodically
examined the presence of all types of RRBs among these individuals. Therefore, it remains
possible that individuals who achieve OOs may exhibit some RRBs that cause impairment in
functioning and may require continued intervention, even while they fail to meet diagnostic
criteria for ASD because of an abatement of social and communication symptoms.

The current study compares children and adolescents with OOs to high-functioning
individuals with a current ASD diagnosis (HFA) and typically developing (TD) peers. We
predicted that the OO group would exhibit mild RRBs that might be clinically significant, but
that these behaviors would not be as frequent or as severe as in the HFA group.

The secondary aim of this study is to examine parents’ report of RRBs in the
OO group in early childhood and to compare the early presentation of RRBs in the OO group to
that of the HFA group. By doing this, we may be able to identify ways in which the early
history of these two groups differed. Previous research suggests that children who achieved
OOs exhibited somewhat milder signs of ASD in early childhood (Sutera et al., 2007; Turner & Stone,
2007). Additionally, researchers have argued that the presence of RRBs prevents a child
from fully attending to the environment, which could make the child unavailable to receive
meaningful input from the social environment. As a result, children who engage in RRBs early
in development may do so at the cost of activities that promote cognitive, social and
communicative development, leading to delays in the development of these skills and
potentially to a more negative outcome (Bodfish, Symons,
Parker, & Lewis, 2000; Bopp, Mirenda, & Zumbo,
2009; Lewis, 2004). In support of this
connection between RRBs and prognosis, several studies have demonstrated that children who
display RRBs early in their preschool years tend to have poorer school-age language outcomes
than children who do not exhibit these behaviors during this age period (Charman et al., 2005; Paul, Chawarska,
Cicchetti, & Volkmar, 2008). Based on these studies, we predicted that
individuals who achieved OOs would display fewer RRBs in early childhood than would the
individuals in the HFA group.
Participants

The sample included in this study was previously described by Fein and colleagues (2013). Thirty-four individuals
with a history of ASD who have achieved OOs, 45 individuals with HFA, and 34 TD peers were
tested. Participants ranged from 8 years, 1 month to 21 years, 8 months. The groups did
not differ on age, gender, and nonverbal IQ (NVIQ), but differed significantly on verbal
IQ (VIQ). The VIQ of the OO and TD groups was about 7 points higher than the HFA
group’s VIQ (See Table 1). Six HFA
participants and three OO participants were evaluated at Queens University in Kingston,
Ontario, Canada. Their performance did not significantly differ from the other
participants on any measure. The participants tested at the University of Connecticut were
primarily from the northeast US. Participants were predominantly Caucasian, with 3 OO
individuals, 2 HFA individuals, and 3 TD individuals reporting other races or ethnicities.
Parents of a subset of participants in each group completed two questionnaires designed to
assess their child’s RRBs and circumscribed interests (see below). No significant
group differences were observed in the gender, age, VIQ, and NVIQ of participants whose
parents completed these measures and those who did not. The study was approved by the
Institutional Review Boards of the University of Connecticut, the Institute of Living
Hartford Hospital, Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, and Queens University.

Participant characteristics.

Note. Table reports means, followed by SDs and ranges. WASI and Vineland
subtest mean=100,SD=10.

Recruitment was done through media outlets (newspaper stories, radio interviews),
private practices, and clinic referrals. Recruitment materials stated that the study
sought individuals “who have lost their ASD diagnosis and have reached an excellent
outcome,” as well as individuals “with high functioning autism” and
“typical development.” All three groups were recruited using the same
materials and the same sites were used to recruit participants for all three groups. In
some cases, therapists contacted parents of children suspected to have OOs, and in some
cases, parents saw media reports about the study and contacted the investigators.
Participants were also referred from the principal investigators’ private
practices, the Psychological Services Clinic at the University of Connecticut, and from
other ongoing studies at the University of Connecticut. Finally, some participants in each
group were informed about the study by other participants’ families. See Figure 1 for a flow chart of inclusion and exclusion.

Flow Chart of Participant Inclusion



All participants had verbal, nonverbal, and full-scale IQ standard scores
greater than 77 (within 1.5 standard deviations (SDs) of the average of 100) on the most
current assessment. See Fein and colleagues
(2013) for a flow chart depicting participant enrollment. Additional criteria
were:

For the OO group: 

Table 4: Repetitive Behavior Scale - Revised (RBS)

Note. Table reports means, followed by SDs and ranges in parentheses, as well as the
percentage of participants who exhibited any degree of repetitive behaviors (received a
score of 1 or higher on any item within the subscale).



For the HFA group: 



For the TD group: 





Potential participants for any group were excluded from the study if (1) at
the time of the telephone screening they exhibited symptoms of major psychopathology
(e.g., active psychotic disorder) that would impede full participation, (2) they had
severe visual or hearing impairments, or (3) they had a history of seizure disorder,
Fragile X syndrome, or significant head trauma with loss of consciousness. Two potential
participants in the TD group and two in the HFA group were excluded because of possible
seizure disorder; none were excluded for other reasons.

Procedure

Phone screenings based on study criteria were conducted with parents of each
potential participant. Those who passed screening were scheduled for an assessment. For
participants under 18, parent consent and child assent was obtained prior to testing. For
participants 18 and over, their informed consent was obtained. The evaluation was
administered in a quiet room over the course of two or three testing sessions at the
University of Connecticut, the Institute of Living of Hartford Hospital, Queens
University, or in the home. Testing lasted approximately six hours. In most cases, parent
interviews were conducted concurrently by a second examiner and lasted approximately three
hours for the OO and HFA groups and 1.5 hours for the TD group. To ensure that
participants met the enrollment criteria for the study, measures examining current
diagnostic status (i.e., OO, HFA, TD; see Measures below) were completed at the outset of
the evaluation by the same examiner who completed the remainder of the assessment. The
participant’s history was discussed during the collection of these measures, and,
as a result, the evaluators were not blind to the participant’s presumed group
status. Participants received a monetary incentive for participation, even if the testing
could not be completed.
Measures

Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule
(ADOS; Lord, Risi, & Lambercht, 2000). Module 3
or 4 (depending on age) was used to determine current diagnostic status for the OO and HFA
groups, to rule out autistic features in the TD group, to compare social interaction in
the OO and TD groups, and to assess RRBs (see below). To confirm inter-rater reliability,
administrations were videotaped and a rater blind to group status coded
five administrations per group. Inter-rater reliability was coded based on the method of
the test authors and was high for both the algorithm and total items, at 86.7% and
85.7%.

Cognitive abilities were measured using the Wechsler
Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI; Wechsler, 1999). The Vineland Adaptive Behavior
Scales (Sparrow, Balla, &
Cicchetti, 1985) is a parent report measure that was used to evaluate adaptive
functioning in Communication, Daily Living Skills and Socialization.

RRBs were assessed using both direct observation and parent report measures.
Direct observation of repetitive motor behaviors, ritualistic behaviors, self-injurious
behaviors, unusual sensory interests, restricted interests and stereotyped behavior was
collected using five items from the ADOS (Lord et al.,
2000).

Parent report of RRBs was collected using parent responses to nine items
assessing current RRBs and a history of RRBs on the Autism Diagnostic
Interview-Revised (ADI-R, Lord, Rutter, &
Le Couteur, 1994). The ADI-R is a semi-structured parent interview used to assess
current and past behaviors necessary for the diagnosis of ASD; if a behavior was present,
severity was assessed. This measure was only administered to parents of participants in
the OO and HFA groups. The “Restricted, Repetitive, and Stereotyped Patterns of
Behavior” domain was assessed on the diagnostic and current behavior algorithms.
This RRBs domain consisted of four subdomains: encompassing preoccupations or
circumscribed interests, compulsive adherence to nonfunctional routines or rituals,
stereotyped and repetitive motor mannerisms, and preoccupations with parts of objects or
nonfunctional elements of materials.

The Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised (RBS-R; Bodfish et al., 2000) was also used to gather parent report of RRBs. The RBS-R
is a parent report measure of a child’s current repetitive behaviors, which are
grouped in six domains: stereotyped, self-injurious, compulsive, ritualistic, sameness and
restricted behaviors. The subscale scores are totaled to arrive at an overall score.
Subscale inter-rater reliability ranges from 0.55 (sameness) to 0.78 (self-injurious;
Bodfish & Lewis, 2002).

The Yale Special Interests Survey (YSIS; Klin & Volkmar, 1996) is a parent-report measure of circumscribed
interests, special skills, and unusual attachments to objects. The questionnaire assesses
special interests separately in four age periods (i.e., preschool, elementary, adolescence
and adulthood). Because of the wide age range of the participants included in the study
and the variability in the age of OO participants when OOs were achieved (i.e., some
participants in the OO group achieved OO during the elementary period, while others were
older), this instrument was used to assess the early history of RRBs during the preschool
period only (ages 2-6). This period was chosen because the inclusion criteria of the study
mandate that all participants in the OO group met diagnostic criteria for ASD during this
period. Using the coding scheme described by Klin,
Danovitch, Merz, and Volkmar (2007), circumscribed interests were coded by a
blind rater into eight descriptive categories (facts/verbal memory and learning, facts and
activities/visual memory and learning, sensory behaviors, math, classifying/ordering
information, dates and times, collecting/hoarding, letters and numbers). Published
inter-rater reliability for this coding scheme ranges from 0.81 to 1.0 (Klin et al., 2007). In addition, topics of
circumscribed interests were coded as being unusual or developmentally appropriate. When
questions arose about how to code interests, they were to be brought to the research group
for consensus coding; however, this was never necessary because the interests reported
clearly fit into one of the categories included in the coding scheme.

Studies of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs) suggest that Restricted and
Repetitive Behaviors (RRBs) are particularly difficult to remediate. We examined present
and past RRBs in 34 individuals who achieved optimal outcomes (OOs; lost their ASD
diagnosis), 45 high-functioning individuals with ASD (HFA) and 34 typically developing
(TD) peers. The OO group exhibited minimal residual RRBs at the time of the study. All OO
participants were reported to have at least one RRB in early childhood and almost 90% met
the RRB cutoff for ASD in early childhood, but RRBs were not more present in the OO than
the TD group at the time of the study. History of RRBs in the HFA and OO groups differed
only in oversensitivity to noise and insistence on sameness. Reports of current behavior
indicated that RRB’s had almost totally disappeared in the OO group. Thus, although
RRB’s were present in the OO group in childhood, they resolved along with social
and communication deficits.

Flow Chart of Participant Inclusion
Current Presentation of RRBs

Direct observation of RRBs using the ADOS revealed that the HFA group had
significantly higher (more abnormal) scores than did the OO and TD groups (see Table 2). An item-by-item analysis revealed that the
HFA group exhibited more unusual sensory interests, hand and finger mannerisms, and
circumscribed interests than did participants in the OO and TD groups (see Table 2). No significant group differences were found
on items assessing self-injurious behaviors, or compulsive or ritualistic behaviors. The
TD and OO groups did not differ from each other on any RRB item of the ADOS.

ADOS Stereotyped Behaviors and Restricted Interests Domain

Note. Table reports means, followed by SDs and ranges in parentheses of
the total and item scores on the Stereotyped Behaviors and Restricted Interests (SBRI)
domain of the ADOS. For significant findings, percentages of participants who exhibited
mild (received a 1 on the ADOS item) or moderate to severe repetitive behavior (received a
2 or 3 on the ADOS item) are reported.

Parent report of current RRBs was assessed using the ADI-R (for HFA and OO
groups) and the RBS-R (for all groups). Parent report of current RRBs using the ADI-R
included a group comparison of current scores on the subdomain and total domain scores of
RRB’s in the current behavior algorithm. Mann-Whitney U Tests revealed that the HFA
group had significantly higher mean scores than the OO group on each of the four subdomain
scores and the domain total score (see Table 3). An
item-by-item analysis revealed that the HFA group had significantly higher scores than the
OO group on items assessing circumscribed interests, undue general sensitivity to noise,
difficulties with minor changes in routine or personal environment, and complex mannerisms
or stereotyped body movements (see Table 3).
Chi-square tests were conducted on these items to explore the distribution of responses,
and indicated that significantly more HFA participants exhibited all four RRBs than did
participants in the OO group (see Table 3). The
item-by-item analysis also revealed that 24% of the OO group exhibited mild circumscribed
interests (i.e., exhibited special interests of an unusual degree, but that did not
interfere with the participant’s other activities or family life; scored
“1” on this item). In addition, 36% of the OO group demonstrated a slight
sensitivity to loud noises (i.e., score of “1”) and 15% of the OO group
displayed negative reactions to minor changes in routine that did not include significant
distress or impairment in family life.

ADI-R Restricted, Repetitive, and Stereotyped Patterns of Behaviors Domain - Current
Rating

Note. Table reports means, followed by SDs and ranges in parentheses.
For significant findings on individual ADI items, percentages of participants who
exhibited mildly repetitive behavior (no impairment in functioning, received
“1” on the ADI item) or moderate to severe repetitive behavior (received a 2
or 3 on the ADI item) are reported.

Parent report of the current presentation of RRBs using the subscales of the
RBS-R, revealed that the HFA group scored significantly higher on all subscales of the
RBS-R than the OO and TD groups (see Table 4). The
only significant difference between the OO and TD groups was on the ritualistic behaviors
subscale, with the OO group’s parents endorsing more items
(U=249.50, z=-3.13, p=.002,
r=.42) and receiving higher subscale scores (U=247.50,
z=−3.17, p=.002, r=.42). These
findings did not change when the groups were compared on the number of items endorsed
within each subscale of the RBS-R rather than the total subscale score. An item-by-item
analysis of the six items that comprise the ritualistic behaviors subscale (see Table 6 indicated that the OO group scored
significantly higher than the TD group only on items assessing eating/mealtime rituals
(U=255.00, z=−3.21, p=.001,
r=0.42), as well as sleeping/bedtime rituals
(U=330.00, z=−2.21, p=0.03,
r=0.30). Group means on this item indicate that, on average, these RRBs
are mild and cause minimal interference on participant functioning (i.e., average score
<1, and a rating of “1” is associated with mild behavior). No
significant difference was found between the OO and HFA groups on these two items, but
these groups differed significantly on the other four items that comprised the ritualistic
behavior subscale (see Table 5). No group
differences were found between the TD and OO groups on subdomains assessing stereotyped
behaviors, self-injurious behaviors, compulsive behaviors, sameness behaviors, or
restricted behaviors.

Scores above 2 on the RRB Diagnostic Algorithm Total score meet the ASD cutoff on the ADI.
For significant findings on individual ADI items, percentages of participants who
exhibited mildly repetitive behavior (no impairment in functioning, received
“1” on the ADI item) or moderate to severe repetitive behavior (received a 2
or 3 on the ADI item) are reported.

In summary, when the current presentation of RRBs was examined using direct
observation, the OO group scores were similar to those of the TD group, and they
demonstrated significantly fewer RRBs than the HFA group. Specifically, the HFA group
exhibited more unusual sensory interests, hand and finger mannerisms and circumscribed
interests than did participants in the other groups. According to parent report, the OO
and TD groups contained fewer participants who exhibited RRBs in all domains assessed than
did the HFA group. Based on parent report, the OO and TD groups only differed
significantly on ritualistic behaviors, specifically rituals around eating and sleeping.
Within the OO group, these RRBs did not interfere with functioning.
History of RRBs

Parent report exploring the history of RRBs was collected using the ADI-R (for
OO and HFA groups) and the YSIS (for all groups). A frequency distribution was conducted
to determine how many participants in the OO group exhibited some form of RRB early in
development. This revealed that every child in the OO group exhibited some form of RRB,
and 87.9% of the OO sample scored at or above the ASD cutoff on the ADI-R RRBs domain, as
compared to 97.7% of the HFA group (see Table 6).
Mann-Whitney U Tests were conducted on each of the four subdomain scores for past behavior
that comprise the RRBs domain of the ADI-R Diagnostic Algorithm, as well as the domain
total score. No significant group differences were found between the HFA and OO groups on
the RRB domain total score for past behavior or on any of the RRB subdomain scores (see
Table 6).

An item-by-item analysis of RRB items included on the ADI-R was conducted using
Mann-Whitney U Tests to determine whether subdomain scores may be masking significant
group differences on specific types of past RRBs. This analysis revealed that the HFA
group showed significantly higher (more severe) mean scores on circumscribed interests,
undue general sensitivity to noise, and difficulties with minor changes in the
child’s routine or personal environment, (see Table
6). The groups did not differ on unusual preoccupations, repetitive use of
objects, ritualistic behavior, unusual sensory interests, abnormal responses to specific
sensory stimuli, resistance to trivial changes in the environment, unusual attachment to
objects, hand and finger mannerisms, stereotyped body movements and midline hand
movements. Follow-up chi-square tests were conducted for the three items on which the
groups differed significantly to examine how many participants in each group showed these
symptoms. The results revealed that the HFA group contained significantly more
participants who exhibited undue sensitivity to noise and difficulties with minor changes
in routine, but not circumscribed interests, than the OO group (see Table 6). This difference in results suggests that equal numbers of OO
and HFA participants had difficulty with circumscribed interests, but that the interests
of the HFA group were more severe.

Parents were also asked to fill out the YSIS, which asked about the presence of
attachment to unusual objects and circumscribed interests during the participants’
preschool years, as well as the extent of participants’ time involved in their
special interests during this time. Chi-square tests revealed that the OO and HFA groups
did not differ from each other, and both groups showed more attachment to unusual objects,
circumscribed interests and unusual interests during the preschool period than the TD
group (see Table 7). Among those participants who
exhibited a circumscribed interest during the preschool years, the HFA and OO groups did
not differ on the frequency with which participants discussed their circumscribed
interests with family members, other adults, or peers, or the amount of free time
participants spent on the circumscribed interest (see Table 7).

Note. Table reports the percentage of participants who exhibited each
behavior and the total number of participants in each cell.

To explore group differences in the content of circumscribed interests, the
interests were coded into eight categories using the coding scheme described by Klin and colleagues (2007): facts/verbal memory and
learning, facts and activities/visual memory and learning, sensory behaviors, math,
classifying/ordering information, dates and times, collecting/hoarding, and letters and
numbers. Chi-square tests (see Figure 2) revealed
that facts learned through verbal and visual memory, and sensory behaviors were the most
common circumscribed interests, and that only for facts learned through verbal memory did
the HFA-OO difference approach significance.

To summarize the history findings, all OO participants exhibited RRBs and most
(87.9%) exhibited enough RRBs early in development to meet the RRB criteria for ASD as
measured by the ADI-R. Furthermore, when general categories of RRBs were examined in early
childhood, no difference was noted between the OO and HFA groups in the severity of RRBs
or the proportion of participants whose parents endorsed a history of RRBs. Differences in
early RRBs were noted between the OO and HFA groups on only one of two measures used
(i.e., ADI-R, not YSIS), and only when the severity of single items assessing specific
RRBs were examined. The OO group received lower scores on circumscribed interests, undue
general sensitivity to noise and difficulty with minor changes in routine. When compared
to the TD group, significantly more participants in the OO and HFA groups exhibited
attachment to unusual objects, circumscribed interests and unusual circumscribed interests
during the preschool period.

Discussion

This study examined the presence of residual RRBs and the history of RRBs among
individuals who were diagnosed with ASDs in early childhood, but who no longer meet
diagnostic criteria for any ASD. History and current presentation of RRBs in the OO group
was compared to RRBs in same aged high-functioning individuals with ASD and TD peers.

Results showed that at the time of this study, individuals who achieved OOs
exhibited similarly low rates of RRBs compared to TD peers. The only difference between the
OO and TD groups was in more ritualistic behaviors around mealtime and bedtime in the OO
group. The majority of participants in the OO group did not exhibit ritualistic behaviors
around mealtime and bedtime, and of those that did (38% for mealtime rituals and 16% for
bedtime rituals), none were reported to cause a severe impairment on functioning. Ritualism
in daily routines is commonly observed among typically developing children and young adults,
and may reduce anxiety by familiarizing the individuals with the sequences of actions during
daily activities (Glenn, Cunningham, & Nananidou,
2012). However, we found that few individuals in our TD sample exhibited these
behaviors. It remains possible that these residual ritualistic behaviors were not targeted
in intervention with the OO group to the same degree as other RRBs because these behaviors
did not interfere with functioning and may have served an adaptive purpose. Overall, the OO
group described in this study appears to be different from previously described cases of
children with ASD who achieved good remission in social and communication impairments, but
who continued to exhibit symptoms of ASD within the RRBs domain that cause impairment in
functioning (e.g., Piven et al. 1996; Seltzer et al., 2004). RRBs have been remediated along
with symptoms within the social and communication cluster in this group of individuals who
achieved OOs. These findings raise important questions about the intervention history of the
OO and HFA group, which has been described by Orinstein and colleagues in a separate report
(in press).

As predicted, the HFA group demonstrated more frequent and more severe RRBs than
the OO and TD groups across most RRB domains assessed. In accordance with previous reports,
these findings suggest that of the core clusters of ASD symptomatology, the RRB cluster
appears to be particularly persistent over the course of development in our sample of
high-functioning individuals with ASD.

It is also important to consider what the results suggest about the history of ASD
symptomatology within this OO sample. These results demonstrate that all participants in the
OO group exhibited at least one type of RRB in early development, and 88% of the OO group
displayed enough RRBs to meet the ASD cutoff of the RRB domain on the ADI-R, a gold standard
measure used in the diagnosis of ASD (Lord et al.,
1994). Generally, the early presentation of RRBs was also similar across the HFA
and OO groups. The results of this study lend support to the assertion that these
individuals were accurately diagnosed with an ASD in early childhood.

Differences in the history of RRBs were found only in the severity of
oversensitivity to noise and insistence on sameness, where individuals in the OO group
exhibited milder symptoms. A number of studies have proposed that RRBs interfere with the
child’s ability to attend to the external environment where learning opportunities
are present and, consequently, may impede learning (Bodfish
et al., 2000; Bopp et al., 2009; Lewis, 2004). It is possible that oversensitivity to
noise and insistence on sameness may interfere with learning of social skills and
communication abilities (Helt et al., 2008). For
instance, oversensitivity to noise may result in avoidance of auditory input, which may
limit the amount of linguistic input a child processes. A decrease in linguistic input may
interfere with the child’s exposure to prototypical social communication and hinder
the development of this skill. Similarly, insistence on sameness may limit the types of
activities in which a child may participate, which may limit the variety of linguistic input
to which the child is exposed and hinder learning within the social communication
domain.

Several important limitations should be considered when drawing conclusions about
this study. The results of this study are limited by a homogeneous sample in terms of
functioning level, ethnicity and socioeconomic status. Consequently, the generalizability of
the current findings to a broader autism population may be limited. The size of the sample
also limited the study’s power to detect small group differences. Finally, the
current study is cross-sectional and cannot shed light on whether the presentation of RRBs
among individuals with OO will change over time. Future studies using a longitudinal design
could confirm that RRBs subside in the OO group and explore the timing of this change in the
presentation of RRBs. Finding that these behaviors subside first would lend support to the
argument that the absence of RRBs may make a child more available for learning of social and
communication skills. Such a finding might also suggest that intervention of ASD should
focus on RRBs early in treatment in order to allow unimpeded learning of other skills.

The current study is also limited by the fact that parent report was used to
assess history of RRBs and current presentation of RRBs for this study. It is well
established that parent report introduces a risk of bias, particularly when parents are
asked to recall past behavior (Bradburn, Rips & Shevell,
1987; Henry, Moffitt, Caspi, Langley, & Silva,
1994; Robbins, 1963). In the current study,
the participant’s functioning at the time of participation may have biased parent
report of the child’s history of RRBs. Two of the measures used to assess RRBs in
this study were also not designed to measure RRB severity (i.e., ADOS, ADI-R). These
measures were supplemented by several parent report measures of RRBs and with a direct
observation of RRBs. However, the observational measure of RRBs depended on a relatively
brief observation period. Given that these behaviors were not commonly observed in the OO
and HFA groups, including a time-limited assessment may have resulted in the evaluators
failing to observe some RRBs that could have been captured during a longer observation. It
remains possible that even with a longer observation period, some RRBs may only be captured
by parent report as children may be less likely to engage in these behaviors in novel
settings and with unfamiliar adults.

Future studies would benefit from a prospective study design and direct
observation of RRBs across development that would help eliminate bias related to parent
report and allow for a standardized assessment of the initial ASD diagnosis in the OO group.
However, without being able to predict which children are likely to experience an OO,
conducting a prospective study of this group would involve a long-term follow-up of a
prohibitively large sample of children with ASD.

It is important to consider that the OO group’s initial ASD diagnoses were
confirmed using the diagnostic criteria published in the DSM-IV-TR (APA, 2000) and it is possible that some individuals within this OO group
would not have met diagnostic criteria for ASD if the recently published DSM-5 (APA, 2013) criteria were used. In addition, it would have
been preferable for evaluators who confirmed current diagnosis and assessed functioning of
participants to be blind to the history and presumed group membership of participants.
However, it was not feasible for the examiner to remain blind because the evaluation
contained measures of ASD symptomatology (e.g., ADI-R, ADOS) that elicited report about
diagnostic history and current functioning. To address this limitation, a blind rater
reviewed a subset of the video recordings of the ADOS and high inter-reliability was
established.

In summary, the results of this study suggest that individuals who were diagnosed
with ASD in early childhood, but who no longer meet diagnostic criteria for any ASD, exhibit
minimal residual RRBs and appear very similar to TD peers in this symptom domain. It remains
for future studies to determine how central to symptom remission the reduction of early RRBs
was for these individuals, and whether these behaviors were particularly targeted in
intervention, or were naturally abated in individuals who achieved OO.

Studies of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs) suggest that Restricted and
Repetitive Behaviors (RRBs) are particularly difficult to remediate. We examined present
and past RRBs in 34 individuals who achieved optimal outcomes (OOs; lost their ASD
diagnosis), 45 high-functioning individuals with ASD (HFA) and 34 typically developing
(TD) peers. The OO group exhibited minimal residual RRBs at the time of the study. All OO
participants were reported to have at least one RRB in early childhood and almost 90% met
the RRB cutoff for ASD in early childhood, but RRBs were not more present in the OO than
the TD group at the time of the study. History of RRBs in the HFA and OO groups differed
only in oversensitivity to noise and insistence on sameness. Reports of current behavior
indicated that RRB’s had almost totally disappeared in the OO group. Thus, although
RRB’s were present in the OO group in childhood, they resolved along with social
and communication deficits.

Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs) are a group of neurodevelopmental disorders believed
to affect as many as one in 88 individuals (Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention [CDC], 2012). These disorders are characterized by deficits in
communication and socialization, as well as by the presence of restricted and repetitive
behaviors (RRBs). ASDs are generally considered to be lifelong disorders (American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2000). However,
several studies have indicated that a small proportion of individuals who are diagnosed with
an ASD early in childhood experience a reduction in autism symptomatology to such a degree
that they no longer meet diagnostic criteria for any ASD as they get older (Cohen, Amerine-Dickens, & Smith, 2007; Fein et al., 2013; Harris & Handleman, 2000; Howlin, Goode, Hutton, & Rutter, 2004; Kelley, Naigles, & Fein, 2010; Kelley, Paul, Fein, & Naigles, 2006; Lovaas, 1987; Rutter, Greenfield, & Lockyer,
1967; Sallows & Graupner, 2005; Seltzer, Shattuck, Abbeduto, & Greenberg, 2004; Sigman & Ruskin, 1999; Szatmari, Bartolucci, Bremner, Bond, & Rich, 1989; Venter, Lord, & Schopler, 1992; Weiss,
1999; Zachor, Ben-Itzchak, Rabinovich, & Lahat,
2007). However, most of these studies did not describe in detail the functioning of
these individuals compared to groups of individuals who still met criteria for
high-functioning ASD.

Some studies documenting such positive outcomes among individuals previously
diagnosed with ASD have suggested that these individuals continue to present with subthreshold
symptoms of ASDs (Piven, Harper, Palmer, & Arndt,
1996). This concern is supported by multiple studies that have demonstrated that core
features of ASD fluctuate with age and generally tend to lessen in severity by the time that
an individual reaches adulthood (Byrd, 2002; Eaves & Ho, 1996; Kobayashi, Murata, & Yoshinaga, 1992; Leekham, Prior, & Uljarevic, 2011;
Piven et al., 1996; Rumsey, Rapoport, & Sceery, 1985; Seltzer et
al., 2004; Shea & Mesibov, 2005). As a
result of this line of research, Seltzer and colleagues
(2004) discussed the possibility that reports of “recovery” in ASD may
reflect this general tendency for symptoms of ASD to improve with age, but argued that the
core features of ASD continue to be present in these individuals.

When considering developmental changes within the three clusters of ASD symptoms in
high-functioning individuals, symptoms within the Restricted and Repetitive Behaviors (RRBs)
cluster tend to persist into adolescence and adulthood, even while social and communication
symptoms in ASD may improve (Leekham et al., 2011; Murphy et
al., 2005; Piven et al., 1996, Seltzer et al., 2004). Some types of RRBs (e.g.,
circumscribed interests) may even increase in severity with age (Bishop, Richler, & Lord, 2006; Rutter
1978; South, Ozonoff, & McMahon, 2005).
Because symptoms within the RRBs cluster may be particularly difficult to remediate, reports
of children who lose their ASD diagnosis as they mature have raised the question of whether
RRBs may persist among these individuals.

Several studies explored the current functioning of children who were once diagnosed
with ASDs and who have achieved “optimal outcomes (OOs)” (Fein et al., 2013; Kelley et al.,
2006, 2010). These studies defined OOs as
referring to children who were diagnosed with ASDs in the preschool period and at the time of
the studies no longer met diagnostic criteria for any ASD, exhibited average IQ and were
mainstreamed into regular education classrooms without one-on-one assistance. Thus far,
studies exploring the functioning of individuals who achieve OOs have not methodically
examined the presence of all types of RRBs among these individuals. Therefore, it remains
possible that individuals who achieve OOs may exhibit some RRBs that cause impairment in
functioning and may require continued intervention, even while they fail to meet diagnostic
criteria for ASD because of an abatement of social and communication symptoms.

The current study compares children and adolescents with OOs to high-functioning
individuals with a current ASD diagnosis (HFA) and typically developing (TD) peers. We
predicted that the OO group would exhibit mild RRBs that might be clinically significant, but
that these behaviors would not be as frequent or as severe as in the HFA group.

The secondary aim of this study is to examine parents’ report of RRBs in the
OO group in early childhood and to compare the early presentation of RRBs in the OO group to
that of the HFA group. By doing this, we may be able to identify ways in which the early
history of these two groups differed. Previous research suggests that children who achieved
OOs exhibited somewhat milder signs of ASD in early childhood (Sutera et al., 2007; Turner & Stone,
2007). Additionally, researchers have argued that the presence of RRBs prevents a child
from fully attending to the environment, which could make the child unavailable to receive
meaningful input from the social environment. As a result, children who engage in RRBs early
in development may do so at the cost of activities that promote cognitive, social and
communicative development, leading to delays in the development of these skills and
potentially to a more negative outcome (Bodfish, Symons,
Parker, & Lewis, 2000; Bopp, Mirenda, & Zumbo,
2009; Lewis, 2004). In support of this
connection between RRBs and prognosis, several studies have demonstrated that children who
display RRBs early in their preschool years tend to have poorer school-age language outcomes
than children who do not exhibit these behaviors during this age period (Charman et al., 2005; Paul, Chawarska,
Cicchetti, & Volkmar, 2008). Based on these studies, we predicted that
individuals who achieved OOs would display fewer RRBs in early childhood than would the
individuals in the HFA group.

The sample included in this study was previously described by Fein and colleagues (2013). Thirty-four individuals
with a history of ASD who have achieved OOs, 45 individuals with HFA, and 34 TD peers were
tested. Participants ranged from 8 years, 1 month to 21 years, 8 months. The groups did
not differ on age, gender, and nonverbal IQ (NVIQ), but differed significantly on verbal
IQ (VIQ). The VIQ of the OO and TD groups was about 7 points higher than the HFA
group’s VIQ (See Table 1). Six HFA
participants and three OO participants were evaluated at Queens University in Kingston,
Ontario, Canada. Their performance did not significantly differ from the other
participants on any measure. The participants tested at the University of Connecticut were
primarily from the northeast US. Participants were predominantly Caucasian, with 3 OO
individuals, 2 HFA individuals, and 3 TD individuals reporting other races or ethnicities.
Parents of a subset of participants in each group completed two questionnaires designed to
assess their child’s RRBs and circumscribed interests (see below). No significant
group differences were observed in the gender, age, VIQ, and NVIQ of participants whose
parents completed these measures and those who did not. The study was approved by the
Institutional Review Boards of the University of Connecticut, the Institute of Living
Hartford Hospital, Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, and Queens University.

Recruitment was done through media outlets (newspaper stories, radio interviews),
private practices, and clinic referrals. Recruitment materials stated that the study
sought individuals “who have lost their ASD diagnosis and have reached an excellent
outcome,” as well as individuals “with high functioning autism” and
“typical development.” All three groups were recruited using the same
materials and the same sites were used to recruit participants for all three groups. In
some cases, therapists contacted parents of children suspected to have OOs, and in some
cases, parents saw media reports about the study and contacted the investigators.
Participants were also referred from the principal investigators’ private
practices, the Psychological Services Clinic at the University of Connecticut, and from
other ongoing studies at the University of Connecticut. Finally, some participants in each
group were informed about the study by other participants’ families. See Figure 1 for a flow chart of inclusion and exclusion.

OOs exhibited somewhat milder signs of ASD in early childhood (Sutera et al., 2007; Turner & Stone,
2007). Additionally, researchers have argued that the presence of RRBs prevents a child
from fully attending to the environment, which could make the child unavailable to receive
meaningful input from the social environment. As a result, children who engage in RRBs early
in development may do so at the cost of activities that promote cognitive, social and
communicative development, leading to delays in the development of these skills and
potentially to a more negative outcome (Bodfish, Symons,
Parker, & Lewis, 2000; Bopp, Mirenda, & Zumbo,
2009; Lewis, 2004). In support of this
connection between RRBs and prognosis, several studies have demonstrated that children who
display RRBs early in their preschool years tend to have poorer school-age language outcomes
than children who do not exhibit these behaviors during this age period (Charman et al., 2005; Paul, Chawarska,
Cicchetti, & Volkmar, 2008). Based on these studies, we predicted that
individuals who achieved OOs would display fewer RRBs in early childhood than would the
individuals in the HFA group.

The sample included in this study was previously described by Fein and colleagues (2013). Thirty-four individuals
with a history of ASD who have achieved OOs, 45 individuals with HFA, and 34 TD peers were
tested. Participants ranged from 8 years, 1 month to 21 years, 8 months. The groups did
not differ on age, gender, and nonverbal IQ (NVIQ), but differed significantly on verbal
IQ (VIQ). The VIQ of the OO and TD groups was about 7 points higher than the HFA
group’s VIQ (See Table 1). Six HFA
participants and three OO participants were evaluated at Queens University in Kingston,
Ontario, Canada. Their performance did not significantly differ from the other
participants on any measure. The participants tested at the University of Connecticut were
primarily from the northeast US. Participants were predominantly Caucasian, with 3 OO
individuals, 2 HFA individuals, and 3 TD individuals reporting other races or ethnicities.
Parents of a subset of participants in each group completed two questionnaires designed to
assess their child’s RRBs and circumscribed interests (see below). No significant
group differences were observed in the gender, age, VIQ, and NVIQ of participants whose
parents completed these measures and those who did not. The study was approved by the
Institutional Review Boards of the University of Connecticut, the Institute of Living
Hartford Hospital, Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, and Queens University.

Participant characteristics.

Note. Table reports means, followed by SDs and ranges. WASI and Vineland
subtest mean=100,SD=10.

Recruitment was done through media outlets (newspaper stories, radio interviews),
private practices, and clinic referrals. Recruitment materials stated that the study
sought individuals “who have lost their ASD diagnosis and have reached an excellent
outcome,” as well as individuals “with high functioning autism” and
“typical development.” All three groups were recruited using the same
materials and the same sites were used to recruit participants for all three groups. In
some cases, therapists contacted parents of children suspected to have OOs, and in some
cases, parents saw media reports about the study and contacted the investigators.
Participants were also referred from the principal investigators’ private
practices, the Psychological Services Clinic at the University of Connecticut, and from
other ongoing studies at the University of Connecticut. Finally, some participants in each
group were informed about the study by other participants’ families. See Figure 1 for a flow chart of inclusion and exclusion.
