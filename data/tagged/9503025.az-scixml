<HEADER ID='H-0'> Introduction </HEADER>
<P>
<S ID='S-0' AZ='BKG'> Word vectors reflecting word meanings are expected to enable numerical approaches to semantics . </S>
<S ID='S-1' AZ='OTH'> Some early attempts at vector representation in psycholinguistics were the semantic differential approach <REF TYPE='P'>Osgood et al. 1957</REF> and the associative distribution approach <REF TYPE='P'>Deese 1962</REF> . </S>
<S ID='S-2' AZ='CTR'> However , they were derived manually through psychological experiments . </S>
<S ID='S-3' AZ='OTH'> An early attempt at automation was made by <REF TYPE='A'>Wilks et al. 1990</REF> using co-occurrence statistics . </S>
<S ID='S-4' AZ='OTH'> Since then , there have been some promising results from using co-occurrence vectors , such as word sense disambiguation <REF TYPE='P'>Schuetze 1993</REF> , and word clustering <REF TYPE='P'>Pereira et al. 1993</REF> . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-5' AZ='CTR'> However , using the co-occurrence statistics requires a huge corpus that covers even most rare words . </S>
<S ID='S-6' AZ='OTH'> We recently developed word vectors that are derived from an ordinary dictionary by measuring the inter-word distances in the word definitions <REF SELF="YES" TYPE='P'>Niwa and Nitta 1993</REF> . </S>
<S ID='S-7' AZ='OTH'> This method , by its nature , has no problem handling rare words . </S>
<S ID='S-8' AZ='AIM'> In this paper we examine the usefulness of these distance vectors as semantic representations by comparing them with co-occurrence vectors . </S>
</P>

<HEADER ID='H-1'> Distance Vectors </HEADER>
<P>
<S ID='S-9' AZ='OTH'> A reference network of the words in a dictionary ( Fig. <CREF/> ) is used to measure the distance between words . </S>
<S ID='S-10' AZ='OTH'> The network is a graph that shows which words are used in the definition of each word <REF SELF="YES" TYPE='P'>Nitta 1988</REF> . </S>
<S ID='S-11' AZ='OTH'> The network shown in Fig. <CREF/> is for a very small portion of the reference network for the Collins English Dictionary ( 1979 edition ) in the CD-ROM I <REF TYPE='P'>Liberman 1991</REF> , with 60K head words + 1.6M definition words . </S>
</P>
<IMAGE ID='I-0'/>
<P>
<S ID='S-12' AZ='OTH'> For example , the definition for dictionary is `` a book in which the words of a language are listed alphabetically ... '' </S>
<S ID='S-13' AZ='OTH'> The word dictionary is thus linked to the words book , word , language , and alphabetical . </S>
<S ID='S-14' AZ='OTH'> A word vector is defined as the list of distances from a word to a certain set of selected words , which we call origins . </S>
<S ID='S-15' AZ='OTH'> The words in Fig. <CREF/> marked with <EQN/> ( unit , book , and people ) are assumed to be origin words . </S>
<S ID='S-16' AZ='OTH'> In principle , origin words can be freely chosen . </S>
<S ID='S-17' AZ='OTH'> In our experiments we used middle frequency words : the 51st to 1050th most frequent words in the reference Collins English Dictionary ( CED ) . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-18' AZ='OTH'> The distance vector for dictionary is derived as follows : </S>
</P>
<IMAGE ID='I-1'/>
<P>
<S ID='S-19' AZ='OTH'> The i-th element is the distance ( the length of the shortest path ) between dictionary and the i-th origin , <EQN/> . </S>
<S ID='S-20' AZ='OTH'> To begin , we assume every link has a constant length of 1 . </S>
<S ID='S-21' AZ='OTH'> The actual definition for link length will be given later . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-22' AZ='OTH'> If word A is used in the definition of word B , these words are expected to be strongly related . </S>
<S ID='S-23' AZ='OTH'> This is the basis of our hypothesis that the distances in the reference network reflect the associative distances between words <REF SELF="YES" TYPE='P'>Nitta 1993</REF> . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-24' AZ='OTH'> Use of Reference Networks</S>
<S ID='S-25' AZ='OTH'> Reference networks have been successfully used as neural networks ( by <REF TYPE='A'>Vronis and Ide 1990</REF> for word sense disambiguation ) and as fields for artificial association , such as spreading activation ( by <REF TYPE='A'>Kozima and Furugori 1993</REF> for context-coherence measurement ) . </S>
<S ID='S-26' AZ='OTH'> The distance vector of a word can be considered to be a list of the activation strengths at the origin nodes when the word node is activated . </S>
<S ID='S-27' AZ='OTH'> Therefore , distance vectors can be expected to convey almost the same information as the entire network , and clearly they are much easier to handle . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-28' AZ='OTH'> Dependence on Dictionaries</S>
<S ID='S-29' AZ='OTH'> As a semantic representation of words , distance vectors are expected to depend very weakly on the particular source dictionary . </S>
<S ID='S-30' AZ='OTH'> We compared two sets of distance vectors , one from LDOCE <REF TYPE='P'>Procter 1978</REF> and the other from COBUILD <REF TYPE='P'>Sinclair 1987</REF> , and verified that their difference is at least smaller than the difference of the word definitions themselves <REF SELF="YES" TYPE='P'>Niwa and Nitta 1993</REF> . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-31' AZ='TXT'> We will now describe some technical details about the derivation of distance vectors . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-32' AZ='OTH'> Link Length</S>
<S ID='S-33' AZ='OTH'> Distance measurement in a reference network depends on the definition of link length . </S>
<S ID='S-34' AZ='OTH'> Previously , we assumed for simplicity that every link has a constant length . </S>
<S ID='S-35' AZ='CTR'> However , this simple definition seems unnatural because it does not reflect word frequency . </S>
<S ID='S-36' AZ='OWN'> Because a path through low-frequency words ( rare words ) implies a strong relation , it should be measured as a shorter path . </S>
<S ID='S-37' AZ='OWN'> Therefore , we use the following definition of link length , which takes account of word frequency . </S>
<IMAGE ID='I-2'/>
<S ID='S-38' AZ='OWN'> This shows the length of the links between words W <EQN/> in Fig. <CREF/> , where N <EQN/> denotes the total number of links from and to W <EQN/> and n denotes the number of direct links between these two words . </S>
<IMAGE ID='I-3'/>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-39' AZ='OWN'> Normalization</S>
<S ID='S-40' AZ='OWN'> Distance vectors are normalized by first changing each coordinate into its deviation in the coordinate : </S>
<IMAGE ID='I-4'/>
<S ID='S-41' AZ='OWN'> where <EQN/> are the average and the standard deviation of the distances from the <EQN/> - th origin . </S>
<S ID='S-42' AZ='OWN'> Next , each coordinate is changed into its deviation in the vector : </S>
<IMAGE ID='I-5'/>
<S ID='S-43' AZ='OWN'> where <EQN/> are the average and the standard deviation of <EQN/> </S>
</P>

<HEADER ID='H-2'> Co-Occurrence Vectors </HEADER>
<P>
<S ID='S-44' AZ='BAS'> We use ordinary co-occurrence statistics and measure the co-occurrence likelihood between two words , X and Y , by the mutual information estimate <REF TYPE='P'>Church and Hanks 1989</REF> . </S>
<IMAGE ID='I-6'/>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-45' AZ='OWN'> where <EQN/> is the occurrence density of word X in a whole corpus , and the conditional probability <EQN/> is the density of X in a neighborhood of word Y. Here the neighborhood is defined as 50 words before or after any appearance of word Y . </S>
<S ID='S-46' AZ='BAS'> ( There is a variety of neighborhood definitions such as `` 100 surrounding words '' <REF TYPE='P'>Yarowsky 1992</REF> and `` within a distance of no more than 3 words ignoring function words '' <REF TYPE='P'>Dagan et al. 1993</REF> . ) </S>
<S ID='S-47' AZ='OWN'> The logarithm with ` + ' is defined to be 0 for an argument less than 1 . </S>
<S ID='S-48' AZ='OWN'> Negative estimates were neglected because they are mostly accidental except when X and Y are frequent enough <REF TYPE='P'>Church and Hanks 1989</REF> . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-49' AZ='OTH'> A co-occurence vector of a word is defined as the list of co-occurrence likelihood of the word with a certain set of origin words . </S>
<S ID='S-50' AZ='OTH'> We used the same set of origin words as for the distance vectors . </S>
<IMAGE ID='I-7'/>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-51' AZ='OTH'> When the frequency of X or Y is zero , we can not measure their co-occurence likelihood , and such cases are not exceptional . </S>
<S ID='S-52' AZ='OTH'> This sparseness problem is well-known and serious in the co-occurrence statistics . </S>
<S ID='S-53' AZ='BAS'> We used as a corpus the 1987 Wall Street Journal in the CD-ROM I <REF TYPE='P'>Liberman 1991</REF> , which has a total of 20 M words . </S>
<S ID='S-54' AZ='OWN'> The number of words which appeared at least once was about 50 % of the total 62 K head words of CED , and the percentage of the word-origin pairs which appeared at least once was about 16 % of total 62 K <EQN/> 1 K ( = 62 M ) pairs . </S>
<S ID='S-55' AZ='OWN'> When the co-occurrence likelihood can not be measured , the value <EQN/> was set to 0 . </S>
</P>

<DIV DEPTH='1'>
<HEADER ID='H-3'> Experimental Results </HEADER>
<P>
<S ID='S-56' AZ='OWN'> We compared the two vector representations by using them for the following two semantic tasks . </S>
<S ID='S-57' AZ='OWN'> The first is word sense disambiguation ( WSD ) based on the similarity of context vectors ; the second is the learning of or meanings from example words . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-58' AZ='OWN'> With WSD , the precision by using co-occurrence vectors from a 20 M words corpus was higher than by using distance vectors from the CED . </S>

<HEADER ID='H-4'> Word Sense Disambiguation </HEADER>
<P>
<S ID='S-59' AZ='BKG'> Word sense disambiguation is a serious semantic problem . </S>
<S ID='S-60' AZ='BKG'> A variety of approaches have been proposed for solving it . </S>
<S ID='S-61' AZ='OTH'> For example , <REF TYPE='A'>Vronis and Ide 1990</REF> used reference networks as neural networks , <REF TYPE='A'>Hearst 1991</REF> used ( shallow ) syntactic similarity between contexts , <REF TYPE='A'>Cowie et al. 1992</REF> used simulated annealing for quick parallel disambiguation , and <REF TYPE='A'>Yarowsky 1992</REF> used co-occurrence statistics between words and thesaurus categories . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-62' AZ='BAS'> Our disambiguation method is based on the similarity of context vectors , which was originated by <REF TYPE='A'>Wilks et al. 1990</REF> . </S>
<S ID='S-63' AZ='OTH'> In this method , a context vector is the sum of its constituent word vectors ( except the target word itself ) . </S>
<S ID='S-64' AZ='OTH'> That is , the context vector for context ,  </S>
<IMAGE ID='I-8'/>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-65' AZ='OTH'> is </S>
<IMAGE ID='I-9'/>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-66' AZ='OTH'> The similarity of contexts is measured by the angle of their vectors ( or actually the inner product of their normalized vectors ) . </S>
<IMAGE ID='I-10'/>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-67' AZ='OTH'> Let word <EQN/> , and each sense have the following context examples . </S>
<IMAGE ID='I-11'/>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-68' AZ='OTH'> We infer that the sense of word <EQN/> in an arbitrary context <EQN/> is <EQN/> , is maximum among all the context examples . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-69' AZ='OTH'> Another possible way to infer the sense is to choose sense <EQN/> such that the average of <EQN/> over <EQN/> is maximum . </S>
<S ID='S-70' AZ='OWN'> We selected the first method because a peculiarly similar example is more important than the average similarity . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-71' AZ='OWN'> Figure <CREF/> ( next page ) shows the disambiguation precision for 9 words . </S>
<S ID='S-72' AZ='OWN'> For each word , we selected two senses shown over each graph . </S>
<S ID='S-73' AZ='OWN'> These senses were chosen because they are clearly different and we could collect sufficient number ( more than 20 ) of context examples . </S>
<S ID='S-74' AZ='OWN'> The names of senses were chosen from the category names in Roget 's International Thesaurus , except organ 's . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-75' AZ='OWN'> The results using distance vectors are shown by dots ( <EQN/> <EQN/> <EQN/> ) , and using co-occurrence vectors from the 1987 WSJ ( 20 M words ) by circles ( <EQN/> <EQN/> <EQN/> ) . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-76' AZ='OWN'> A context size ( x-axis ) of , for example , 10 means 10 words before the target word and 10 words after the target word . </S>
<S ID='S-77' AZ='OWN'> We used 20 examples per sense ; they were taken from the 1988 WSJ . </S>
<S ID='S-78' AZ='OWN'> The test contexts were from the 1987 WSJ : The number of test contexts varies from word to word ( 100 to 1000 ) . </S>
<S ID='S-79' AZ='OWN'> The precision is the simple average of the respective precisions for the two senses . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-80' AZ='OWN'> The results of Fig. <CREF/> show that the precision by using co-occurrence vectors are higher than that by using distance vectors except two cases , interest and customs . </S>
<S ID='S-81' AZ='OWN'> And we have not yet found a case where the distance vectors give higher precision . </S>
<S ID='S-82' AZ='OWN'> Therefore we conclude that co-occurrence vectors are advantageous over distance vectors to WSD based on the context similarity . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-83' AZ='OWN'> The sparseness problem for co-occurrence vectors is not serious in this case because each context consists of plural words . </S>

<HEADER ID='H-5'> Learning of positive-or-negative </HEADER>
<P>
<S ID='S-84' AZ='OWN'> Another experiment using the same two vector representations was done to measure the learning of or meanings . </S>
<S ID='S-85' AZ='OWN'> Figure <CREF/> shows the changes in the precision ( the percentage of agreement with the authors ' combined judgement ) . </S>
<S ID='S-86' AZ='OWN'> The x-axis indicates the number of example words for each or pair . </S>
<S ID='S-87' AZ='OWN'> Judgement was again done by using the nearest example . </S>
<S ID='S-88' AZ='OWN'> The example and test words are shown in Tables <CREF/> and <CREF/> , respectively . </S>
<IMAGE ID='I-12'/>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-89' AZ='OWN'> In this case , the distance vectors were advantageous . </S>
<S ID='S-90' AZ='OWN'> The precision by using distance vectors increased to about 80 % and then leveled off , while the precision by using co-occurrence vectors stayed around 60 % . </S>
<S ID='S-91' AZ='OWN'> We can therefore conclude that the property of positive-or-negative is reflected in distance vectors more strongly than in co-occurrence vectors . </S>
<S ID='S-92' AZ='OWN'> The sparseness problem is supposed to be a major factor in this case . </S>

<HEADER ID='H-6'> Supplementary Data </HEADER>
<P>
<S ID='S-93' AZ='OWN'> In the experiments discussed above , the corpus size for co-occurrence vectors was set to 20 M words ( ' 87 WSJ ) and the vector dimension for both co-occurrence and distance vectors was set to 1000 . </S>
<S ID='S-94' AZ='OWN'> Here we show some supplementary data that support these parameter settings </S>

<S ID='S-95' AZ='OWN'> Corpus size ( for co-occurrence vectors ) . </S>
<S ID='S-96' AZ='OWN'> Figure <CREF/> shows the change in disambiguation precision as the corpus size for co-occurrence statistics increases from 200 words to 20 M words . </S>
<S ID='S-97' AZ='OWN'> ( The words are suit , issue and race , the context size is 10 , and the number of examples per sense is 10 . ) These three graphs level off after around 1 M words . </S>
<S ID='S-98' AZ='OWN'> Therefore , a corpus size of 20 M words is not too small . </S>
