Infant muscle tone and childhood autistic traits: A longitudinal study in the general population.

Abstract

In a longitudinal population-based study of 2905 children, we investigated if infants’ neuromotor development was associated with autistic traits in childhood.

Overall motor development and muscle tone were examined by trained research assistants with an adapted version of Touwen’s Neurodevelopmental Examination between ages 2–5 months. Tone was assessed in several positions and items were scored as normal, low or high tone. Parents rated their children’s autistic traits with the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) and the Pervasive Developmental Problems (PDP) subscale of the Child Behavior Checklist at 6 years. We defined clinical PDP if scores were >98th percentile of the norm population. Diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) was clinically confirmed in 30 children.

We observed a modest association between overall neuromotor development in infants and autistic traits. Low muscle tone in infancy predicted autistic traits measured by SRS (adjusted beta=0.05, 95% CI for B: 0.00–0.02, p=0.01), and PDP (adjusted beta=0.08, 95% CI for B: 0.04–0.10, p<0.001). Similar results emerged for the association of low muscle tone and clinical PDP (adjusted OR=1.36, 95% CI: 1.08–1.72, p=0.01) at age 6 years. Results remained unchanged if adjusted for child intelligence. There was no association between high muscle tone and SRS or PDP. Exclusion of children with ASD diagnosis did not change the association.

This large study showed a prospective association of infant muscle tone with autistic traits in childhood. Our findings suggest that early detection of low muscle tone might be a gateway to improve early diagnosis of ASD.

Exclusion of children with ASD diagnosis did not change the association.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder characterized by persistent impairments in social communication and interaction, and repetitive stereotyped behaviors that manifest in early childhood (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Subclinical deficits in social communication or some degree of repetitive behaviors that do not meet the diagnostic criteria for ASD are defined as autistic traits and exist in the general population (Constantino & Todd, 2003).

Neuromotor function during infancy is an important early indicator of central nervous system development. Numerous studies in clinical or high-risk populations have demonstrated a close relationship between neuromotor development and ASD (Bhat, Galloway, & Landa, 2012; Brian et al., 2008; Flanagan, Landa, Bhat, & Bauman, 2012; LeBarton & Iverson, 2013; Lloyd, MacDonald, & Lord, 2013). For example, Landa, Gross, Stuart, and Faherty (2013) reported a worsening of fine motor performance over the first 3 years of life in infants later diagnosed with ASD. Bhat, Landa, and Galloway (2011) proposed that early motor delays within the first two years of life may contribute to the social impairments of children with ASD.

As individuals with ASD are at the high end of the distribution of autistic traits (Constantino, 2011), infant neuromotor development may also be associated with autistic traits in children from the general population. In a population-based cohort, Bolton, Golding, Emond, and Steer (2012) showed that maternal report of fine motor delays at 6 months predicted later diagnoses of ASD, as well as autistic traits. Such motor milestones, which are typically assessed retrospectively based on caregivers report, cannot be measured reliably before age of 6 months.

Several studies reported problems with muscle tone in children with ASD. Adrien et al. (1993) rated family home movies of 12 infants who were later diagnosed as autistic and 12 typically developing infants. They observed a high prevalence of low muscle tone in children with autistic traits. Ming, Brimacombe, and Wagner (2007) investigated a cohort of children with ASD using retrospective clinical record review and found a higher prevalence of gross and fine motor impairment among 2–6 year old children with ASD. The children typically had mild to moderate hypotonia early in life.

It remains unknown if differences in infant neuromotor development, and in particular muscle tone, as early as 2–5 months may serve as a prodromal sign of autistic traits. Such information can facilitate early detection of children at risk for ASD and potentially allow for early intervention. The purpose of the current study was to explore whether variations in infant neuromotor development are associated with childhood autistic traits in the general population. We hypothesized that non-optimal neuromotor development, and in particular muscle tone, in infants are related to autistic traits in childhood.

We applied two parental rating scales to study autistic traits in childhood: the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) and the Pervasive Developmental Problems (PDP) scale of the Child Behavior Checklist for toddlers (CBCL/1½–5). The use of parental reports on children’s social behavior provides an informative mean of examining autistic traits, as parents are familiar with everyday behavior of their children. Parental reports provide the contextual information with high ecological validity. We also obtained information on ASD diagnosis, if available.

This study was conducted within the Generation R Study, a population-based cohort that follows children from fetal life onwards (Jaddoe et al., 2012; Tiemeier H, 2012). Briefly, mothers were eligible if they were living in the Rotterdam area, the Netherlands, and had a delivery date between April 2002 and January 2006. When infants were 2–5months old, their neuromotor development was assessed during a home visit by trained research assistants. Neuromotor assessment was completed in 4055 infants. These 4055 children were the eligible participants for this follow-up study. When the children were 6 years old, questionnaires were mailed to caregivers in order to assess autistic traits in the children. Information on autistic traits was available in 2905 children (72 % of 4055). The Medical Ethics Committee of the Erasmus Medical Centre approved the study and written informed consent was obtained from all adult participants.
Neuromotor and Muscle Tone Assessment

Neuromotor assessment is an accepted means of measuring the maturity and intactness of an infant’s central nervous system. Its relevance is demonstrated by the fact that impaired development of the central nervous system in the first year of life is expressed mainly in neuromotor delay (Prechtl, 1977; Touwen, 1976). Depending on the instrument neuromotor developmental measures assess muscle tone and primitive reflexes or emphases behavior and coping with environmental stimuli.

Infants underwent a neuromotor assessment at a corrected postnatal age between 9 and 20 weeks. Two versions of neuromotor assessment instrument were used: One for infants aged 9–15 weeks and the other for infants aged 15–20 weeks. We selected age-appropriate items from Touwen’s Neurodevelopmental Examination, and categorized items in three groups: tone, responses, and other observations (de Groot, Hopkins, & Touwen, 1992) (Table 1). Muscle tone is the degree of passive resistance to movement (Foster, 1895). Tone was assessed in several positions –supine, horizontal, vertical, prone and sitting– and all items, such as adductor angle, were scored as normal, low or high tone. Responses were assessed in supine (e.g. asymmetrical tonic neck reflex), vertical (e.g. Moro response) or prone position (e.g. Bauer response) and were scored as present, absent or excessive. Other observations, such as following movements, were scored as present, absent or excessive. Assessment of overall neuromotor development and tone was used in this analysis. For each item, an age-appropriate response was labelled ‘optimal’. If the response indicated a delayed development, it was labelled ‘non-optimal’. By summing the raw values of all items, we obtained a total score, with high values indicating less optimal neuromotor development.

Items on neuromotor developmental assessment (9–15 weeks version)*

Research assistants were trained by a movement scientist who also was a child physiotherapist specialized in child motor development. Training consisted of a lecture about the theory of neuromotor development. Furthermore, the neuromotor assessment and the practical procedure and protocol were explained in detail. Next, research assistants carried out hands-on assessment during home visits while accompanied by a trained assistant until assessments were carried out properly. During the whole data collection period, there were schooling meetings on a regular basis. The aim of these meetings was to refresh knowledge about neuromotor assessment and discuss special cases encounter during the home visits. Research assistants were blinded of previous results. To investigate inter-observer reliability, two research assistants independently conducted a neuromotor assessment in a sample of 76 children. The intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) was 0.64. Moreover, we performed a reliability study to test the short-interval test-retest interobserver reliability and the interobserver reliability. The short-interval test-retest interobserver reliability test (n=61) consisted of a first assessment by a research assistant, followed within one week by a second assessment by another research assistant. For the interobserver reliability test (n=76), two research assistants together went on a home visit in which they independently conducted two consecutive neuromotor assessments in the same child. The ICC’s for the short-interval test-retest reliability and the interobserver reliability were .52 and .64, respectively. The ICC’s for the reliability of the neuromotor assessment were in the ‘modest’ (.41–.60) to ‘substantial’ (.61–.80) range (Cohen, 1968), and in line with a study (Peters, Maathuis, Kouw, Hamming, & Hadders-Algra, 2008) who reported a moderate to good reliability of a modified Touwen examination. However, it is difficult to compare these values with a criterion as the ICC is influenced by features of the data, such as its variability (the ICC will be greater if the observations are more variable).

Over a period of approximately three years (children were born between April 2002 and January 2006) neuromotor assessments were performed by in total 15 trained research assistants. Six of them participated in the reliability study. Furthermore, the trained research assistants were blinded for gestational age of the infants.
Child Autistic Traits



Due to length of the original questionnaire, and the need to minimize subject burden, we used a short-form SRS with 18 items for assessment of autistic traits based on parent’s observation of the child’s social behavior in a naturalistic setting. Each item is rated from ‘0’ (never true) to 3 (almost always true), covering social, language, and repetitive behaviors; higher scores indicate more problems (Constantino & Todd, 2003; Roman et al., 2013). In a sample of 3857 children aged 4–18 years (part of the Social Spectrum Study, a multi-center study on social development of children referred to a mental health care institution in the South-West of the Netherlands from 2010–2012) the correlation between total scores derived from the SRS short-form (18 items) and the SRS scores derived from the complete instrument was r=0.95 (p<0.001). The correlation between SRS short-form and SRS total scores in Missouri Twin Study was 0.93 in monozygotic male twins (n=98) and 0.94 in dizygotic male twins (n=134).



The CBCL/1½–5 is a validated instrument to measure behavioral and emotional problems of children at young age. The Dutch version is reliable and well-validated (Tick, van der Ende, Koot, & Verhulst, 2007). The PDP is one of the five scales that can be derived from the CBCL/1½–5, consistent with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 4th edition diagnostic categories. The PDP has been shown to be a useful screening instrument to identify children with ASD when compared with Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-Generic (Sikora, Hall, Hartley, Gerrard-Morris, & Cagle, 2008). It has a good predictive validity to identify preschoolers at risk of ASD (sensitivity=0.85. specificity=0.90) (Muratori et al., 2011). At 6 years, the correlation coefficient between the PDP and SRS scores was r=0.6 (p<0.001, n=2275).



Only diagnoses made by a specialist as part of the regular clinical care were used. These diagnoses were retrieved from general practitioners; in the Dutch health care system, all specialists are obliged to inform the general practitioner as the primary health care provider, who holds the central medical records. To the aim of checking general practitioners’ records, we selected those children for which one of three sources of information signaled possible ASD. First, children who screened positive on the Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ), a 40-item parent-reported screening instrument for ASD. All children who scored in the top 15th percentile on the CBCL/1½–5 total score or those in the top 2nd percentile on the PDP subscale were screened with this instrument (Berument, Rutter, Lord, Pickles, & Bailey, 1999). Second, we retrieved medical records from the general practitioners of all children who had weighted scores over 1.078 for boys and 1.000 for girls on the SRS-short form (Constantino, 2002). Third we retrieved medical records in all children of whom the mother at any contact moment up to age 8 years had reported that the child had undergone a diagnostic procedure for possible ASD. Only children for whom a diagnosis of ASD could be confirmed by specialist medical records were considered ASD cases in the analyses. The specialist diagnoses of ASD were generally based on clinical consensus by a multidisciplinary team. The standard diagnostic work-up involves an extensive developmental case history obtained from parents, as well as school information, and repeated observations of the child.

Covariates

Characteristics such as maternal age, household income, child ethnicity, maternal educational level, as well as maternal lifestyle, were assessed by questionnaires. The child’s national origin was defined based on the national origin of parents and grandparents. Dutch ethnicity was used as the reference group. The education level of the mother was assessed by the highest completed education and reclassified into 3 categories: “low” (less than 3 years of secondary school), “mid” (at most intermediate vocational training), and “high” (at least college education). Household income, defined as the total net monthly income of the household, was categorized into <1200 Euros (below social security level), 1200–2200 Euros (low income), and >2200 Euros (modal income and above). We used the Brief Symptom Inventory, a validated self-report questionnaire, to measure maternal psychopathology during pregnancy (De Beurs, 2004). Child nonverbal IQ was assessed during the child’s visit to the research center at the age of 6, using two subtests of the validated Dutch test battery Snijders-Oomen Niet-verbale intelligentietest-Revisie (Tellegen, Winkel, Wijnberg-Williams, & Laros, 2005). These subtests were Mosaics (assesses spatial visualization abilities), and categories (accesses abstract reasoning abilities). Raw non-verbal IQ scores were standardized using age-defined norms. In our previous study, we showed that infant neuromotor development is not associated with verbal expressive language ability and therefore we did not include this variable as a covariate in the analysis (Serdarevic et al., 2015).

Information about birth weight and gestational age at birth as well as complications during pregnancy or delivery were obtained from the medical records and midwives’ practices. Gestational age was determined by fetal ultrasound examination. Postnatal age was calculated as the difference between date of assessment and date of birth.
Statistical Analyses

Participants’ characteristics are presented in Table 2. In this cohort (n=2905), 48.8% children were male and 54.5% had Dutch ethnic background; 55.0% mothers completed higher education and 79.3% families had a monthly income >2000 Euros. Neuromotor development was assessed at an average age of 12.6 weeks (SD=2) postnatally.

We included children with an assessment of neuromotor development between 2 to 5 months and at least one autistic trait measure in the analyses (n=2905). Missing values on covariates and autistic traits were imputed using multiple imputations. Five copies of the original data set were generated. Standardized effect sizes were calculated as the average effect size of five imputed data sets.

Infant’s overall neuromotor development and muscle tone were determinants in all analyses. The neuromotor assessment scores were highly skewed in this non-clinical population. Therefore, we categorized the sum scores into tertiles in line with a prior study (van Batenburg-Eddes et al., 2013). The lowest tertile represents the most optimal neuromotor development and the highest the least optimal neuromotor development. These tertiles were analyzed continuously, as well as categorically. The associations of neuromotor development and muscle tone with autistic traits were assessed with linear regression. Both outcome measures, i.e. SRS and PDP, had a skewed distribution, and were therefore transformed using a logarithm function. We also categorized PDP scores in order to facilitate the clinical interpretation of the findings. For this purpose, the 98th (clinical) percentile of a Dutch norm group was used as a cut-off score to classify children with behavioral problems within the clinical range of the PDP (Tick et al., 2007). We explored the associations of neuromotor development and muscle tone with clinical PDP using logistic regression.

To assess whether our results were driven by children in the clinical end of the spectrum, we conducted a sensitivity analysis excluding children with a confirmed diagnosis of ASD. We also explored the associations with confirmed diagnosis of ASD using logistic regression.

Selection of covariates was based on prior literature. Final models were adjusted for the child’s age, gender, gestational age at birth, Apgar score at 5 minutes, child ethnicity, child IQ, household income, age-appropriate version of motor instrument, maternal age, maternal education, and maternal psychopathology during pregnancy.



We compared child and maternal characteristics of the children included in the analysis (n=2905) with those excluded because of missing data on outcome (n=1190). Children of responding mothers were more likely to have higher IQ (mean 103.1) compared to children of nonresponding mothers (mean 96.4). They were also more likely to be Dutch (61.2% vs 34.0%, p<0.001) compared to children of nonresponding mothers. Responding mothers also had less severe psychopathology symptoms (mean 0.24) compared with nonresponding mothers (mean 0.37). However, children included scored similarly on muscle tone compared to children not included (score: 1.92 vs 1.96, p=0.54).

Results

Associations of neuromotor development and muscle tone with autistic traits measured continuously by the SRS are presented in Table 3. Overall neuromotor development and autistic traits were significantly associated in the unadjusted model (beta=0.06, 95% CI: 0.01, 0.02, p=0.001). Adjustment for maternal education, age and psychopathology attenuated the association (adjusted beta=0.04, 95% CI: 0.00, 0.02, p=0.05). Muscle tone in infants predicted autistic traits in children measured by the SRS (adjusted beta=0.05, 95%CI: 0.00, 0.02, p=0.016). This association remained significant for low muscle tone and SRS after adjustment for all confounders (adjusted beta=0.05, 95%CI: 0.00, 0.02, p=0.006), while there was no association between high muscle tone and SRS in unadjusted and adjusted analyses (adjusted beta=0.03, 95%CI:−0.004, 0.02, p=0.23).

The association between neuromotor development and autistic traits measured by PDP scores is presented in Table 4. We found an association between overall muscle tone and PDP scores in children. Less optimal muscle tone was significantly associated with PDP scores (adjusted beta=0.05, 95%CI: 0.02, 0.09, p=0.010). Low muscle tone predicted PDP scores (adjusted beta=0.08, 95%CI: 0.04, 0.10, p<0.001), with the third tertile being strongly associated with outcome (adjusted beta=0.09, 95%CI: 0.08, 0.21, p<0.001), whereas the second tertile was not (adjusted beta=0.03, 95% CI:−0.04, 0.13, p=0.29). Results adjusted for child IQ remained essentially unchanged (Table 4). The SRS and PDP in 3 categories of low muscle tone are presented in Figures 1 and ​and22.

In an additional analysis, we present the association between neuromotor development and the dichotomized PDP scale using the clinical cut off. Consistent with the above results, the odds of having PDP scores in the clinical range was associated with low muscle tone in infancy (adjusted OR=1.36, 95%CI: 1.08, 1.72, p=0.01) (Table 5). Children with low muscle tone in the highest tertile had higher odds of PDP in the clinical range compared to other children. Other results were not significant.

For muscle tone first tertile has been used as the reference category.

To assess whether results were driven by children with ASD, we repeated the analyses excluding children with a confirmed diagnosis of ASD (n=30, 0.9%). This exclusion did not materially change the results (adjusted beta of the second tertile of low muscle tone=0.02, 95%CI: −0.01, 0.03, p=0.25, adjusted beta of the third tertile of low muscle tone=0.05, 95%CI: 0.00, 0.04, p =0.01).

Next, we tested the association between low muscle tone and a confirmed diagnosis of ASD. We observed that a non-optimal low muscle tone increased the odds of ASD (adjusted OR for the second tertile=1.99, 95%CI: 0.69, 5.70, p=0.20, adjusted OR for the third tertile=1.44, 95%CI: 0.54, 3.83, p=0.46), although results did not reach significance due to small number of confirmed ASD cases. In the sample of 30 children with ASD the description of the median of the SRS and PDP scores in 3 categories of low muscle tone is presented graphically (Figures 3 and ​and44).

Discussion

In a longitudinal population-based study of 2905 children, we investigated if infants’ neuromotor development was associated with autistic traits in childhood.

Overall motor development and muscle tone were examined by trained research assistants with an adapted version of Touwen’s Neurodevelopmental Examination between ages 2–5 months. Tone was assessed in several positions and items were scored as normal, low or high tone. Parents rated their children’s autistic traits with the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) and the Pervasive Developmental Problems (PDP) subscale of the Child Behavior Checklist at 6 years. We defined clinical PDP if scores were >98th percentile of the norm population. Diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) was clinically confirmed in 30 children.

We observed a modest association between overall neuromotor development in infants and autistic traits. Low muscle tone in infancy predicted autistic traits measured by SRS (adjusted beta=0.05, 95% CI for B: 0.00–0.02, p=0.01), and PDP (adjusted beta=0.08, 95% CI for B: 0.04–0.10, p<0.001). Similar results emerged for the association of low muscle tone and clinical PDP (adjusted OR=1.36, 95% CI: 1.08–1.72, p=0.01) at age 6 years. Results remained unchanged if adjusted for child intelligence. There was no association between high muscle tone and SRS or PDP. Exclusion of children with ASD diagnosis did not change the association.

This large study showed a prospective association of infant muscle tone with autistic traits in childhood. Our findings suggest that early detection of low muscle tone might be a gateway to improve early diagnosis of ASD.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder characterized by persistent impairments in social communication and interaction, and repetitive stereotyped behaviors that manifest in early childhood (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Subclinical deficits in social communication or some degree of repetitive behaviors that do not meet the diagnostic criteria for ASD are defined as autistic traits and exist in the general population (Constantino & Todd, 2003).

Neuromotor function during infancy is an important early indicator of central nervous system development. Numerous studies in clinical or high-risk populations have demonstrated a close relationship between neuromotor development and ASD (Bhat, Galloway, & Landa, 2012; Brian et al., 2008; Flanagan, Landa, Bhat, & Bauman, 2012; LeBarton & Iverson, 2013; Lloyd, MacDonald, & Lord, 2013). For example, Landa, Gross, Stuart, and Faherty (2013) reported a worsening of fine motor performance over the first 3 years of life in infants later diagnosed with ASD. Bhat, Landa, and Galloway (2011) proposed that early motor delays within the first two years of life may contribute to the social impairments of children with ASD.

As individuals with ASD are at the high end of the distribution of autistic traits (Constantino, 2011), infant neuromotor development may also be associated with autistic traits in children from the general population. In a population-based cohort, Bolton, Golding, Emond, and Steer (2012) showed that maternal report of fine motor delays at 6 months predicted later diagnoses of ASD, as well as autistic traits. Such motor milestones, which are typically assessed retrospectively based on caregivers report, cannot be measured reliably before age of 6 months.

Several studies reported problems with muscle tone in children with ASD. Adrien et al. (1993) rated family home movies of 12 infants who were later diagnosed as autistic and 12 typically developing infants. They observed a high prevalence of low muscle tone in children with autistic traits. Ming, Brimacombe, and Wagner (2007) investigated a cohort of children with ASD using retrospective clinical record review and found a higher prevalence of gross and fine motor impairment among 2–6 year old children with ASD. The children typically had mild to moderate hypotonia early in life.

It remains unknown if differences in infant neuromotor development, and in particular muscle tone, as early as 2–5 months may serve as a prodromal sign of autistic traits. Such information can facilitate early detection of children at risk for ASD and potentially allow for early intervention. The purpose of the current study was to explore whether variations in infant neuromotor development are associated with childhood autistic traits in the general population. We hypothesized that non-optimal neuromotor development, and in particular muscle tone, in infants are related to autistic traits in childhood.

We applied two parental rating scales to study autistic traits in childhood: the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) and the Pervasive Developmental Problems (PDP) scale of the Child Behavior Checklist for toddlers (CBCL/1½–5). The use of parental reports on children’s social behavior provides an informative mean of examining autistic traits, as parents are familiar with everyday behavior of their children. Parental reports provide the contextual information with high ecological validity. We also obtained information on ASD diagnosis, if available.

This study was conducted within the Generation R Study, a population-based cohort that follows children from fetal life onwards (Jaddoe et al., 2012; Tiemeier H, 2012). Briefly, mothers were eligible if they were living in the Rotterdam area, the Netherlands, and had a delivery date between April 2002 and January 2006. When infants were 2–5months old, their neuromotor development was assessed during a home visit by trained research assistants. Neuromotor assessment was completed in 4055 infants. These 4055 children were the eligible participants for this follow-up study. When the children were 6 years old, questionnaires were mailed to caregivers in order to assess autistic traits in the children. Information on autistic traits was available in 2905 children (72 % of 4055). The Medical Ethics Committee of the Erasmus Medical Centre approved the study and written informed consent was obtained from all adult participants.

Neuromotor assessment is an accepted means of measuring the maturity and intactness of an infant’s central nervous system. Its relevance is demonstrated by the fact that impaired development of the central nervous system in the first year of life is expressed mainly in neuromotor delay (Prechtl, 1977; Touwen, 1976). Depending on the instrument neuromotor developmental measures assess muscle tone and primitive reflexes or emphases behavior and coping with environmental stimuli.

Infants underwent a neuromotor assessment at a corrected postnatal age between 9 and 20 weeks. Two versions of neuromotor assessment instrument were used: One for infants aged 9–15 weeks and the other for infants aged 15–20 weeks. We selected age-appropriate items from Touwen’s Neurodevelopmental Examination, and categorized items in three groups: tone, responses, and other observations (de Groot, Hopkins, & Touwen, 1992) (Table 1). Muscle tone is the degree of passive resistance to movement (Foster, 1895). Tone was assessed in several positions –supine, horizontal, vertical, prone and sitting– and all items, such as adductor angle, were scored as normal, low or high tone. Responses were assessed in supine (e.g. asymmetrical tonic neck reflex), vertical (e.g. Moro response) or prone position (e.g. Bauer response) and were scored as present, absent or excessive. Other observations, such as following movements, were scored as present, absent or excessive. Assessment of overall neuromotor development and tone was used in this analysis. For each item, an age-appropriate response was labelled ‘optimal’. If the response indicated a delayed development, it was labelled ‘non-optimal’. By summing the raw values of all items, we obtained a total score, with high values indicating less optimal neuromotor development.

Research assistants were trained by a movement scientist who also was a child physiotherapist specialized in child motor development. Training consisted of a lecture about the theory of neuromotor development. Furthermore, the neuromotor assessment and the practical procedure and protocol were explained in detail. Next, research assistants carried out hands-on assessment during home visits while accompanied by a trained assistant until assessments were carried out properly. During the whole data collection period, there were schooling meetings on a regular basis. The aim of these meetings was to refresh knowledge about neuromotor assessment and discuss special cases encounter during the home visits. Research assistants were blinded of previous results. To investigate inter-observer reliability, two research assistants independently conducted a neuromotor assessment in a sample of 76 children. The intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) was 0.64. Moreover, we performed a reliability study to test the short-interval test-retest interobserver reliability and the interobserver reliability. The short-interval test-retest interobserver reliability test (n=61) consisted of a first assessment by a research assistant, followed within one week by a second assessment by another research assistant. For the interobserver reliability test (n=76), two research assistants together went on a home visit in which they independently conducted two consecutive neuromotor assessments in the same child. The ICC’s for the short-interval test-retest reliability and the interobserver reliability were .52 and .64, respectively. The ICC’s for the reliability of the neuromotor assessment were in the ‘modest’ (.41–.60) to ‘substantial’ (.61–.80) range (Cohen, 1968), and in line with a study (Peters, Maathuis, Kouw, Hamming, & Hadders-Algra, 2008) who reported a moderate to good reliability of a modified Touwen examination. However, it is difficult to compare these values with a criterion as the ICC is influenced by features of the data, such as its variability (the ICC will be greater if the observations are more variable).

Over a period of approximately three years (children were born between April 2002 and January 2006) neuromotor assessments were performed by in total 15 trained research assistants. Six of them participated in the reliability study. Furthermore, the trained research assistants were blinded for gestational age of the infants.
Strengths and Limitations

Our study has several strengths, including the longitudinal design and large sample size recruited from the general population. The prospective nature of the study ensured that infant neuromotor development measurements were assessed blind to the eventual later autistic traits. Research nurses assessed neuromotor development using a hands-on test battery, independently of mothers, eliminating common method bias, which can affect motor mile stone research based on parent report (Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Lee, & Podsakoff, 2003). Also, we were able to adjust for large number of prenatal and postnatal covariates.

The present study also has limitations. Although clinical assessment of ASD was available, no standardized formal evaluation with the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, which is considered the gold standard, was performed. Selection effects were observed in our non-response analysis. The non-response may reduce the generalizability but is less likely to bias the associations between variables (Wolke et al., 2009). Some studies have shown that social or communicative therapy can influence ASD outcome; this could have slightly reduced the observed effect (MacDonald, Lord, & Ulrich, 2013; Sutera et al., 2007). Also, we do not know if any of children in our study received an intervention for neuromotor delays, but this is unlikely, as most children with subclinical traits receive no treatment. This study examined neuromotor development and autistic traits in a large sample of children from the general population. The clinical implications of the effects with modest sizes should be considered with caution.

Conclusion

Low muscle tone in infancy predicted autistic traits at age 6 years. High muscle tone was not associated with autistic traits. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first longitudinal population-based study that shows the long-term association of very early low infant muscle tone development with autistic traits in childhood. The earliest observable traits of ASD involve motor behaviour. There is a growing awareness of the developmental importance of impaired motor function in ASD and its association with social skill. This study suggests that muscle tone as part of the motor system development might be a gateway to improving early detection of ASD. Motor problems, in particular low muscle tone in early infancy as an early symptom or precursor of autistic traits requires increased attention.

Acknowledgments

In a longitudinal population-based study of 2905 children, we investigated if infants’ neuromotor development was associated with autistic traits in childhood.

Overall motor development and muscle tone were examined by trained research assistants with an adapted version of Touwen’s Neurodevelopmental Examination between ages 2–5 months. Tone was assessed in several positions and items were scored as normal, low or high tone. Parents rated their children’s autistic traits with the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) and the Pervasive Developmental Problems (PDP) subscale of the Child Behavior Checklist at 6 years. We defined clinical PDP if scores were >98th percentile of the norm population. Diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) was clinically confirmed in 30 children.

We observed a modest association between overall neuromotor development in infants and autistic traits. Low muscle tone in infancy predicted autistic traits measured by SRS (adjusted beta=0.05, 95% CI for B: 0.00–0.02, p=0.01), and PDP (adjusted beta=0.08, 95% CI for B: 0.04–0.10, p<0.001). Similar results emerged for the association of low muscle tone and clinical PDP (adjusted OR=1.36, 95% CI: 1.08–1.72, p=0.01) at age 6 years. Results remained unchanged if adjusted for child intelligence. There was no association between high muscle tone and SRS or PDP. Exclusion of children with ASD diagnosis did not change the association.

This large study showed a prospective association of infant muscle tone with autistic traits in childhood. Our findings suggest that early detection of low muscle tone might be a gateway to improve early diagnosis of ASD.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder characterized by persistent impairments in social communication and interaction, and repetitive stereotyped behaviors that manifest in early childhood (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Subclinical deficits in social communication or some degree of repetitive behaviors that do not meet the diagnostic criteria for ASD are defined as autistic traits and exist in the general population (Constantino & Todd, 2003).

Neuromotor function during infancy is an important early indicator of central nervous system development. Numerous studies in clinical or high-risk populations have demonstrated a close relationship between neuromotor development and ASD (Bhat, Galloway, & Landa, 2012; Brian et al., 2008; Flanagan, Landa, Bhat, & Bauman, 2012; LeBarton & Iverson, 2013; Lloyd, MacDonald, & Lord, 2013). For example, Landa, Gross, Stuart, and Faherty (2013) reported a worsening of fine motor performance over the first 3 years of life in infants later diagnosed with ASD. Bhat, Landa, and Galloway (2011) proposed that early motor delays within the first two years of life may contribute to the social impairments of children with ASD.

As individuals with ASD are at the high end of the distribution of autistic traits (Constantino, 2011), infant neuromotor development may also be associated with autistic traits in children from the general population.
