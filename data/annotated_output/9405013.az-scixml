AIM	We present a plan-based model of how agents collaborate on reference of this sort .	A-1
OWN	In making a reference , an agent uses the most salient attributes of the referent .	A-2
OWN	In understanding a reference , an agent determines his confidence in its adequacy as a means of identifying the referent .	A-3
OWN	To collaborate , the agents use judgment , suggestion , and elaboration moves to refashion an inadequate referring expression .	A-4
BKG	In conversation , a person sometimes has to refer to an object that is not previously known to the other participant .	S-0
BKG	One particular situation in which this arises is in giving directions .	S-1
BKG	For example :	S-2
BKG	The hearer has to understand the reference well enough that when he later reaches the building , he will recognize it as the intended referent .	S-3
BKG	A reference of this sort is often achieved through a collaboration between the conversants .	S-4
BKG	In such cases , the speaker has the goal of having the hearer know how to identify an object .	S-5
BKG	The speaker attempts to achieve this goal by building a description of the object that she believes will give the hearer the ability to identify it when it is possible to do so .	S-6
BKG	The hearer needs to be confident that the description will be adequate as a means of identifying the referent , but because of the inevitable differences in beliefs about the world , he might not be .	S-7
BKG	When the hearer is not confident , the speaker and hearer collaborate to make a new referring expression that the hearer believes is adequate .	S-8
BKG	This can be seen in the following portion of a telephone conversation recorded by, p. 196 .	S-9
BKG	In this dialogue , speaker B is not confident that he will be able to identify the intersection at Lowell Street , and so suggests that the intersection might be marked .	S-10
BKG	Speaker A replies with an elaboration of the initial expression , and B finds that he is now confident , and so accepts the reference .	S-11
CTR	This type of reference is different from the type that has been studied traditionally by researchers who have usually assumed that the agents have mutual knowledge of the referent,,,,, are copresent with the referent,, or have the referent in their focus of attention.	S-12
OTH	In these theories , the speaker has the intention that the hearer either know the referent or identify it immediately .	S-13
OWN	Although the type of reference that we wish to model does not rely on these assumptions , we can nevertheless draw from these theories .	S-14
BAS	Thus , we base our model on the work of, andwho both modeled ( the first psychologically , and the second computationally ) how people collaborate on reference to objects for which they have mutual knowledge .	S-15
TXT	We will briefly discuss these models , before we describe our own .	S-16
OTH	In their fundamental experiment ,demonstrated that conversants use a set of inherently collaborative procedures to establish the mutual belief that the hearer has understood a reference .	S-17
OTH	In the experiment , two subjects were each given a set of hard-to-describe tangram figures that were kept hidden from the other .	S-18
OTH	One subject was required to get the other subject to rearrange his set to match the ordering of her set , and to do so through conversation alone .	S-19
OTH	Thus , the two subjects were obliged to collaborate on constructing descriptions of the figures that would allow them to be unambiguously identified ; for example , the one that looks like an angel with a stick .	S-20
OTH	developed the following process model to explain their findings .	S-21
OTH	To initiate the process , speaker A presents an initial version of a referring expression on which speaker B passes judgment .	S-22
OTH	B can either accept it , reject it , or postpone his decision until later .	S-23
OTH	If B rejects or postpones , then the expression must be refashioned by either A or B. Refashionings are accomplished in three main ways : repairing the expression by correcting speech errors , expanding the expression by adding more qualifications , or replacing part or all of the expression with new qualifications .	S-24
OTH	Each judgment / refashioning pair operates on the current referring expression , replacing it with a new one .	S-25
OTH	This process continues until the expression , kept in the participants ' common ground , is mutually accepted .	S-26
OTH	This excerpt from's data illustrates rejection ( line 2 ) , replacement ( line 2 ) , and acceptance ( lines 3 and 4 ) :	S-27
OTH	rendered's model computationally by casting it into the planning paradigm .	S-28
OTH	Their model covers both the initiator of a referring action , and the recipient who tries to understand the reference .	S-29
OTH	In this model , the initiator has the goal of having the recipient identify the referent , and so constructs a referring plan given a set of beliefs about what the recipient believes .	S-30
OTH	The result of the initiator 's plan is a set of surface speech actions , and hearing only these actions , the recipient tries to infer a plan in order to understand the reference .	S-31
OTH	Thus , referring expressions are represented as plan derivations , and an unsuccessful referring expression is an invalid plan in whose repair the agents collaborate .	S-32
OTH	An agent can infer a plan even if it is invalid in that agent 's view.	S-33
OTH	The evaluation process attempts to find an instantiation of the variables such that all of the constraints are satisfied and the mental actions executable with respect to the hearer 's beliefs about the speaker 's beliefs .	S-34
OTH	If the recipient finds the initial referring expression plan invalid , then the agents will collaborate in its repair .	S-35
OTH	used plan repair techniques to refashion an expression , and used discourse plans , or meta-plans , to communicate the changes to it .	S-36
OTH	Thus , a collaborative dialogue is modeled in terms of the evolution of the referring plan .	S-37
OTH	First , an agent must communicate that she has not understood a plan .	S-38
OTH	Depending on how the referring plan constrains the choice of referent , she constructs an instance of either reject-plan or postpone-plan , whose resulting surface speech actions are s-reject and s-postpone respectively .	S-39
OTH	Next , one agent or the other must refashion the referring expression plan in the context of the judgment by either replacing some of its actions ( by using replace-plan ) or by adding new actions to it ( by using expand-plan ) .	S-40
OTH	The result of both plans is the surface speech action s-actions .	S-41
OTH	Because the model can play the role of both the initiator and the recipient , and because it can perform both plan construction and inference , two copies of the model can converse with one another , acting alternately as speaker and hearer .	S-42
OTH	Acting as hearer , one copy of the system performs plan inference on each set of surface speech actions that it observes , and updates the state of the collaboration .	S-43
OTH	It then switches roles to become the speaker , and looks for a goal to adopt , and constructs a plan that achieves it .	S-44
OTH	After responding with the surface actions of the plan , it updates the state of the collaboration , presupposing that the other copy will accept the plan .	S-45
OTH	The system repeats the process until it can find no more goals to adopt , at which time it switches back to being the hearer and waits for a response from the other copy .	S-46
OTH	A crucial assumption of's work -- and of's model -- is that the recipient of the initial referring expression already has some knowledge of the referent in question .	S-47
OTH	In's experiments , for example , it is one of the tangram figures .	S-48
OTH	In other words , the hearer can understand a referring expression if its content uniquely describes an object that he knows about .	S-49
CTR	Obviously , an agent cannot use this criterion to understand the reference to the building in Example-- he has never heard of the building before .	S-50
OWN	What criteria , then , does he base his understanding on ?	S-51
OWN	The basis of our model is that the hearer can accept a referring expression plan if	S-52
OWN	the plan contains a description that is useful for making an identification plan that the hearer can execute to identify the referent , and	S-53
OWN	the hearer is confident that the identification plan is adequate .	S-54
OWN	The first condition , originally described by, is important because the success of the referring action depends on the hearer formulating a useful identification plan .	S-55
OWN	We take the referring expression plan itself to be the identification plan .	S-56
OWN	The mental actions in the plan will encode only useful descriptions .	S-57
OWN	For the second condition to hold , the hearer must believe that the identification plan is good enough to uniquely identify the referent when it becomes visible .	S-58
OWN	This involves giving enough information by using the most salient attributes of the referent .	S-59
OWN	In our model , each agent associates a numeric confidence value with each of the attributes in the referring expression , and by composing these , computes a level of confidence in the adequacy of the complete referring expression plan that can be interpreted as ranging from low confidence to high confidence .	S-60
OWN	The present composition function is simple addition , but one could envision more complex systems to compute confidence , such as an algebra of confidence or a non-numeric system .	S-61
OWN	If the overall confidence value exceeds some set value , the agent 's confidence threshold , then the agent believes the plan is adequate .	S-62
OWN	That is , if the agent is the initiator , she believes that the other will be able to understand the reference ; if the agent is the other , he believes that he has understood the reference .	S-63
OWN	Now , the confidence value of each attribute is equivalent to its salience within the context of the referring expression .	S-64
OWN	Salience , for our purposes in direction-giving , is primarily visual prominence , but can also involve identifiability , familiarity , and functional importance,.	S-65
OTH	One approach is to encode the salient properties in a static hierarchy as, andhave done .	S-66
CTR	But , ideally , salience should depend on the context surrounding the referent .	S-67
CTR	For example , the height of a tall building would normally be salient , but not if it were surrounded by other tall buildings .	S-68
OWN	This computation would be quite complex , so we have adopted a middle ground between the simple context-independent approaches , and a full-blown contextual analysis .	S-69
OWN	The middle ground involves taking the type of object into account when choosing attributes and landmarks that relate to it .	S-70
OWN	For example , height and architectural style can be very salient features for describing a building , but not for describing an intersection , for which having a sign or traffic lights is important .	S-71
OWN	This approach still allows us to encode salience in a hierarchy , but it is dependent on the referent .	S-72
OWN	Tableshows an example of a simple salience hierarchy that an agent might have .	S-73
OWN	The hierarchy is actually a set of partial orderings of attributes , represented by lambda expressions , indexed by object type .	S-74
OWN	In the table , the confidence value of using architectural style to describe a building is 4 .	S-75
OWN	The confidence value of a tall building is 3 , and so this attribute is less salient than architectural style .	S-76
OWN	The other rows ( for describing intersections ) follow similarly .	S-77
OWN	Each agent has his own beliefs about salience .	S-78
OWN	It is the difference in their beliefs that leads to the necessity for collaboration on reference .	S-79
OWN	Ideally , the initiator should construct referring expressions with the recipients ' ( believed ) beliefs about salience in mind , but we have chosen to avoid this complexity by making the simplifying assumption that the initiator is an expert ( and thus knows best what is salient ) .	S-80
OWN	An agent uses his salience hierarchy for two related purposes : the first to determine what is salient in a particular situation , and the second to determine the adequacy of a description .	S-81
OWN	So , the hierarchy is accessed during both plan construction and plan inference .	S-82
OWN	In plan construction , the hierarchy is used for constructing initial referring expression plans , and for elaborating on inadequate plans by allowing an agent to choose the most salient properties of the referent first .	S-83
OWN	The agent constructs an initial referring expression plan in almost the same way as in's system .	S-84
OWN	Mental actions in the intermediate plans of a referring expression plan allow the speaker to choose the most salient attributes that have not yet been chosen , and constraints in the surface speech actions make sure the speaker believes that each attribute is true .	S-85
OWN	Other mental actions in the intermediate plans add up the confidence values of the attributes , and a final constraint makes sure that the sum exceeds the agent 's confidence threshold .	S-86
OWN	So , for a referring plan to be valid , it must describe a unique object , and it must be adequate with respect to the speaker 's beliefs .	S-87
OWN	This means that attributes beyond those required for a unique description could be necessary .	S-88
OWN	For example , to construct the reference to the building in Example, the speaker consulted her salience hierarchy ( in table) and determined that architectural style is salient .	S-89
OWN	Hence , she described the building as funny-looking .	S-90
OWN	This single attribute was enough to exceed her confidence threshold .	S-91
OWN	During plan inference , the salience hierarchy is used when evaluating a recognized plan .	S-92
OWN	The mental actions in the intermediate plans determine the confidence values of each attribute ( from the hearer 's salience hierarchy ) , and add them up .	S-93
OWN	The final constraint in the plan makes sure that the hearer 's confidence threshold is exceeded .	S-94
OWN	Thus , judging the adequacy of a referring expression plan falls out of the regular plan evaluation process .	S-95
OWN	If the final constraint does not hold , then the invalidity is noted so that the plan can be operated on appropriately by the discourse plans .	S-96
OWN	For example , after recognizing the reference in Example, the hearer evaluates the plan .	S-97
OWN	Assuming he believes the salience information in table, he computes the confidence value of 4 .	S-98
OWN	If this value exceeds his confidence threshold , then he will accept the plan .	S-99
OWN	If not , he will believe that there is an error at the constraint that checks his confidence threshold .	S-100
OWN	If the recipient is not confident in the adequacy of the plan , he uses an instance of postpone-plan to inform the initiator that he is not confident of its adequacy , thereby causing the initiator to raise her own confidence threshold .	S-101
OWN	Now , although he cannot refashion the expression himself , he does have the ability to help the initiator by suggesting a good way to expand it ; suggestion is a conversational move in which an agent suggests a new attribute that he deems would increase his confidence in the expression 's adequacy if the expression were expanded to include the attribute .	S-102
OWN	Continuing with the example , if the hearer were not confident about the adequacy of the funny-looking building , he might suggest that the initiator use height ( as well as architectural style ) , by asking Is it tall ?	S-103
OWN	From this suggestion the initiator might expand her expression to the tall funny-looking building .	S-104
OWN	So , in our sense , a suggestion is an illocutionary act of questioning ; along with actually suggesting a way to expand a plan , the agent is asking whether or not the referent has the suggested attribute .	S-105
OWN	To decide what suggestion to make , the agent uses an instance of suggest-expand-plan , which has a mental action in its decomposition that chooses the attribute that he believes is the most salient that has not been used already .	S-106
OWN	The result of the plan is the surface speech action , s-suggest , that communicates the suggestion .	S-107
OWN	However , only the initiator of the referring expression can actually elaborate a referring expression , because only she has the knowledge to do so .	S-108
OWN	Depending on whether the hearer of the expression makes a suggestion or not , the initiator has two options when elaborating a plan .	S-109
OWN	If no suggestion was made , then she can expand the plan according to her own beliefs about the referent 's attributes and their salience .	S-110
OWN	On the other hand , if a suggestion was made , she could instead attempt to expand the plan by affirming or denying the attribute suggested .	S-111
OWN	If possible , she should use the suggestion to elaborate the plan , thus avoiding unwanted conversational implicature , but its use may not be enough to make the plan adequate .	S-112
OWN	The decomposition of expand-plan calls the plan constructor with the goal of constructing a modifiers schema and with the suggested attribute as input -- in a sense , continuing the construction of the initial referring plan .	S-113
OWN	The plan constructor attempts to find a plan with the surface speech actions for the suggested attribute in its yield , but this might not be possible .	S-114
OWN	In any case , the speaker constructs an expansion that will make the plan adequate according to her beliefs .	S-115
OWN	The response to a suggestion depends , obviously , on whether or not the suggestion was used to expand the plan .	S-116
OWN	The speaker can	S-117
OWN	affirm that the plan was expanded with the suggestion by using the s-affirm speech act ;	S-118
OWN	affirm that the suggestion was used , along with additional attributes that weren't suggested , by using s-affirm and s-actions ; or	S-119
OWN	deny the suggestion with s-deny , and inform the other by s-actions as to how the plan was expanded .	S-120
OWN	By repeatedly using the postponement , elaboration , and suggestion moves , the two agents collaborate through discourse on refashioning the referring expression until they mutually believe that the recipient is confident that it is adequate .	S-121
OWN	We have implemented the model in Prolog .	S-122
OWN	Tableshows the input / output of two copies of the system engaging in a simplified version of Example.	S-123
OWN	Note that the system generates and understands utterances in the form of descriptions of the surface speech actions , not surface natural language forms .	S-124
OWN	The existence of a parser and a generator that can map between the two forms is assumed .	S-125
BAS	Complete details of this example and of the model are given by.	S-126
BKG	When an agent refers to a particular object that is not previously known to another agent , she has the intention that the agent be able to identify the object ( when it is possible to do so ) by means of the referring expression .	S-127
BKG	Because of the inevitable differences in their beliefs about the world -- specifically about what is salient -- the agents may have to collaborate to make the expression adequate .	S-128
AIM	We have implemented a computational plan-based model that accounts for the collaborative nature of reference in the domain of interactive direction-giving .	S-129
OWN	An agent constructs a referring expression plan by using the referent 's most salient features .	S-130
OWN	An agent understands a reference once he is confident in the adequacy of its ( inferred ) plan as a means of identifying the referent .	S-131
OWN	To collaborate , the agents use judgment , suggestion , and elaboration moves to refashion the referring expression until they mutually believe that the recipient has understood .	S-132
