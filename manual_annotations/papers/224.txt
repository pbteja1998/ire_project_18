Demand for organic foods is partially driven by consumers' perceptions that they are more
nutritious. However, scientific opinion is divided on whether there are significant nutritional
differences between organic and non-organic foods, and two recent reviews have concluded that
there are no differences. In the present study, we carried out meta-analyses based on 343
peer-reviewed publications that indicate statistically significant and meaningful differences
in composition between organic and non-organic crops/crop-based foods. Most importantly, the
concentrations of a range of antioxidants such as polyphenolics were found to be substantially
higher in organic crops/crop-based foods, with those of phenolic acids, flavanones, stilbenes,
flavones, flavonols and anthocyanins being an estimated 19 (95 % CI 5, 33) %, 69 (95 % CI 13,
125) %, 28 (95 % CI 12, 44) %, 26 (95 % CI 3, 48) %, 50 (95 % CI 28, 72) % and 51 (95 % CI 17,
86) % higher, respectively. Many of these compounds have previously been linked to a reduced
risk of chronic diseases, including CVD and neurodegenerative diseases and certain cancers, in
dietary intervention and epidemiological studies. Additionally, the frequency of occurrence of
pesticide residues was found to be four times higher in conventional crops, which also
contained significantly higher concentrations of the toxic metal Cd. Significant differences
were also detected for some other (e.g. minerals and vitamins) compounds. There is evidence
that higher antioxidant concentrations and lower Cd concentrations are linked to specific
agronomic practices (e.g. non-use of mineral N and P fertilisers, respectively) prescribed in
organic farming systems. In conclusion, organic crops, on average, have higher concentrations
of antioxidants, lower concentrations of Cd and a lower incidence of pesticide residues than
the non-organic comparators across regions and production seasons.

Demand for organic foods is partially driven by consumers' perceptions that they are more
nutritious. However, scientific opinion is divided on whether there are significant nutritional
differences between organic and non-organic foods, and two recent reviews have concluded that
there are no differences. In the present study, we carried out meta-analyses based on 343
peer-reviewed publications that indicate statistically significant and meaningful differences
in composition between organic and non-organic crops/crop-based foods. Most importantly, the
concentrations of a range of antioxidants such as polyphenolics were found to be substantially
higher in organic crops/crop-based foods, with those of phenolic acids, flavanones, stilbenes,
flavones, flavonols and anthocyanins being an estimated 19 (95 % CI 5, 33) %, 69 (95 % CI 13,
125) %, 28 (95 % CI 12, 44) %, 26 (95 % CI 3, 48) %, 50 (95 % CI 28, 72) % and 51 (95 % CI 17,
86) % higher, respectively. Many of these compounds have previously been linked to a reduced
risk of chronic diseases, including CVD and neurodegenerative diseases and certain cancers, in
dietary intervention and epidemiological studies. Additionally, the frequency of occurrence of
pesticide residues was found to be four times higher in conventional crops, which also
contained significantly higher concentrations of the toxic metal Cd. Significant differences
were also detected for some other (e.g. minerals and vitamins) compounds. There is evidence
that higher antioxidant concentrations and lower Cd concentrations are linked to specific
agronomic practices (e.g. non-use of mineral N and P fertilisers, respectively) prescribed in
organic farming systems. In conclusion, organic crops, on average, have higher concentrations
of antioxidants, lower concentrations of Cd and a lower incidence of pesticide residues than
the non-organic comparators across regions and production seasons.

Increased public concerns about the negative environmental and health impacts of agrochemicals
(pesticides, growth regulators and mineral fertilisers) used in crop production have been major
drivers for the increase in consumer demand for organic foods over the last 20 years(

1

–

3

).

Organic crop production standards prohibit the use of synthetic chemical crop protection
products and certain mineral fertilisers (all N, KCl and superphosphate) to reduce environmental
impacts (nitrate () leaching and P run-off and pesticide contamination of groundwater) and the
risk of pesticide residues being present in crop plants(

4

). Instead, they prescribe regular inputs of organic fertilisers (e.g. manure and
composts), use of legume crops in rotation (to increase soil N levels), and application of
preventative and non-chemical crop protection methods (e.g. the use of crop rotation, more
resistant/tolerant varieties, mechanical and flame weeding, and biological disease and pest
control products). However, organic standards permit the use of certain plant or microbial
extract and/or mineral (e.g. Cu- and S-based) crop protection products(

5

,

6

).

As a result, organic and conventional crop production may differ significantly in crop rotation
designs and fertilisation and crop protection protocols as well as in the type of crop varieties
used(

6

–

10

). Apart from minimising the risk of agrochemical residues being present in crops, the
agronomic protocols used in organic farming systems may also affect mineral uptake patterns and
metabolic processes in crop plants. Recent studies have shown that the switch from mineral to
organic fertilisers results in significant differences in gene and protein expression patterns
and, as a result, in secondary metabolite profiles; for example, approximately 10 % of proteins
have been found to be either up- or down-regulated in response to contrasting fertiliser inputs
in potato and wheat(

10

–

15

). Also, a switch from pesticide-based conventional to organic crop protection
protocols has been shown to have a significant, but more limited effect than fertilisation
regimens, and there were some statistically significant interactions between fertilisation and
crop protection protocols with respect to gene and protein expression pattern(

10

–

15

).

Over the last 20 years, a large number of scientific studies have compared the concentrations
of nutritionally relevant minerals (e.g. Fe, Zn, Cu and Se), toxic metals (e.g. Cd and Pb),
pesticide residues, macronutrients (e.g. proteins, fats and carbohydrates) and secondary
metabolites (e.g. antioxidants, (poly)phenolics and vitamins) in crops from organic and
conventional production systems (see the online supplementary material for a list of
publications).

There is particular interest in antioxidant activity/concentrations, as there is strong
scientific evidence for health benefits associated with increased consumption of crops rich in
(poly)phenolics and other plant secondary metabolites with antioxidant activity (e.g. carotenoids
and vitamins C and E)(

16

–

18

). Most importantly, a substantial number of human dietary intervention studies have
reported an increased dietary intake of antioxidant/(poly)phenolic-rich foods to protect against
chronic diseases, including CVD, certain cancers (e.g. prostate cancer) and neurodegenerative
diseases; a detailed description of the evidence has been given in recent reviews by Del Rio
et al.
(

16

) and Wahlqvist(

17

). Also, these plant secondary metabolites are increasingly being recognised to
contribute significantly to the health benefits associated with increased fruit, vegetable and
whole grain consumption(

16

–

18

).

Several systematic literature reviews have recently analysed the available published
information, using both qualitative and quantitative methods, with the aim of identifying the
potential effects of organic and conventional production protocols on the nutritional quality of
crops(

19

–

21

). However, these systematic reviews (1) used different methodologies (e.g. weighted
and unweighted meta-analyses) and inclusion criteria, (2) did not cover most of the large amount
of information published in the last 4–5 years, (3) provided no structured assessment of the
strength of the evidence presented, and (4) came to contrasting conclusions. As a result, there
is still considerable controversy as to whether the use of organic production standards results
in significant and consistent changes in the concentrations of potentially health-promoting (e.g.
antioxidants, (poly)phenolics, vitamins and certain minerals) and potentially harmful (e.g. Cd
and Pb) compounds in crops and crop-based foods(

7

,

19

–

22

). However, there is increasing evidence and more widespread acceptance that the
consumption of organic foods is likely to reduce exposure to pesticide residues(

21

,

23

,

24

).

There are major research synthesis challenges to assessing differences in crop composition
resulting from farming practices. Most importantly, the studies available for meta-analyses (1)
have used different experimental designs (e.g. replicated field experiments, farm surveys and
retail surveys) and (2) have been carried out in countries/regions with contrasting agronomic and
pedo-climatic background conditions (see the online supplementary material for a list of
publications). This heterogeneity is likely to increase the amount of published data required to
detect and understand variation in composition parameters resulting from the use of contrasting
crop production methods. An additional problem is that many studies do not report measures of
variation, which reduces the within-study power of unweighted analyses and the between-study
power of weighted analyses. Weighted meta-analyses are widely regarded as the most appropriate
statistical approach for comparing data sets from studies with variable experimental
designs(

25

,

26

). However, some studies have used unweighted analytical methods(

19

) to avoid the loss of information associated with conducting weighted meta-analyses
on a subset of the available information.

Therefore, the main objectives of the present study were to (1) carry out a systematic
literature review of studies focused on quantifying composition differences between organic and
conventional crops, (2) conduct weighted and unweighted meta-analyses of the published data, (3)
carry out sensitivity analyses focused on identifying to what extent meta-analysis results are
affected by the inclusion criteria (e.g. using mean or individual data reported for different
crop varieties or experimental years) and meta-analysis method (e.g. weighted v.
unweighted), and (4) discuss meta-analysis results in the context of the current knowledge about
the nutritional impacts of compounds for which significant composition differences were detected.

The present study specifically focused on plant secondary metabolites (especially
antioxidants/(poly)phenolics and vitamins), potentially harmful synthetic chemical pesticides,
toxic metals (including Cd, As and Pb), , nitrite (), macronutrients (including proteins, amino acids, carbohydrates and reducing
sugars) and minerals (including all plant macro- and micronutrients). Metabolites produced by
micro-organisms on plants (e.g. mycotoxins) were not the subject of the present systematic
literature review and meta-analyses.
Literature search: inclusion criteria and search strategy

The literature search strategy and meta-analysis protocols used were based on those
previously published by Brandt et al.
(

27

), and flow diagrams of the protocols used are shown in Figs. 1 and ​and2.2. Relevant publications
were identified through an initial search of the literature with Web of Knowledge using the
following search terms: (1) organic* or ecologic* or biodynamic*; (2) conventional* or
integrated; (3) names of ninety-eight relevant crops and foods (see online supplementary Table
S1 for a full list). Publications in all languages, published in peer-reviewed journals, and
reporting data on both desirable and undesirable composition parameters were considered
relevant for inclusion in the meta-analyses. The search was restricted to the period between
January 1992 (the year when legally binding organic farming regulations were first introduced
in the European Union) and December 2011 (the year when the project ended) and provided 17 333
references. An additional 208 publications (published between 1977 and 2011) were found by (1)
studying lists of references or (2) directly contacting the authors of the published papers and
reviews identified in the initial literature search. The abstracts of all publications were
then examined to determine whether they contained original data obtained by comparing
composition parameters in organic and conventional plant foods. This led to the identification
of 448 suitable publications. Of these, 105 papers were subsequently rejected, because reading
of the full papers indicated that they did not report suitable data sets or contained the same
data as other studies.



Summary of the search and selection protocols used to identify papers included in the
meta-analyses. * Review carried out by one reviewer; † Data extraction carried out by two
reviewers. CF, comparison of matched farms; BS, basket studies; EX, controlled field

* References are summarised in Table S2 (available online). RD, risk difference.

Data sets were deemed suitable if the mean concentrations of at least one mineral,
macronutrient, secondary metabolite or / or the frequency of occurrence of pesticide residues in organic and
conventional crops or crop-based foods were reported. Only four non-peer-reviewed papers with
suitable data sets were identified but subsequently rejected, as the small number minimised any
potential bias(

28

) from using peer review as a ‘quality’ selection criterion.

As a result, 343 peer-reviewed publications reporting crop composition data were selected for
data extraction, of which 156 references fulfilled the criteria for inclusion in the standard
weighted meta-analysis and 343 fulfilled the criteria for inclusion in the standard unweighted
meta-analysis. This represents a significantly greater evidence base than the three previous
systematic reviews/meta-analyses of comparative crop composition data(

19

–

21

). All publications included in these previous reviews (including studies published
before 1992) were also used in the standard weighted meta-analysis carried out in the present
study, except for a small number of papers that were found to report the same data as other
publications that had already been included.

Data were extracted from three types of comparative studies: (1) comparisons of matched farms
(CF), farm surveys in which samples were collected from organic and conventional farms in the
same country or region; (2) basket studies (BS), retail product surveys in which organic and
conventional products were collected in retail outlets; (3) controlled field experiments (EX)
in which samples were collected from experimental plots managed according to organic or
conventional farming standards/protocols. Data from all the three types of studies were deemed
relevant for the meta-analyses if the authors stated that (1) organic farms included in farm
surveys were using organic farming methods, (2) organic products collected in retail surveys
were labelled as organic, and (3) organic plots used in EX were managed according to organic
farming standards.

Several studies compared more than one organic or conventional system or treatment. For
example, additional conventional systems/treatments were described as ‘integrated,’ ‘low
input,’ ‘low fertility’ or ‘extensive’, and an additional organic system/treatment included in
some studies was described as ‘biodynamic’. Also, in some publications, organic or conventional
systems with contrasting rotation designs (e.g. with or without cover crops) or fertilisation
regimens (different types and levels of N inputs) were compared. In such cases, only the
organic and conventional (non-organic) system identified by the authors as closest to the
typical, contemporary organic/conventional farming system was used in the meta-analyses, as
recommended by Brandt et al.
(

20

). Full references of the publications and a summary of descriptions of the studies
included in the meta-analyses are given in Tables S2 and S4 (available online).

The database generated and used for the meta-analyses will be made freely available on the
Newcastle University website (http://research.ncl.ac.uk/nefg/QOF) for use and scrutiny by
others.
Data and information extraction and validation

Information and data were extracted from all the selected publications (see above) and
compiled in a Microsoft Access database. A list of the information extracted from the
publications and recorded in the database is given in Table S4 (available online).

Data reported as numerical values in the text or tables were copied directly into the
database. Only data published in graphical form were enlarged, printed, measured (using a
ruler) and then entered into the database as described previously(

20

).

Where data for multiple time points were reported, two approaches were used, depending on
whether the analysed crop tissue was likely to be used as food/feed. For crops that are
continuously harvested (e.g. tomato and cucumber), analytical data for mature/ripe products
(e.g. fruits) collected at multiple time points during the season were averaged before being
used in the standard meta-analyses; if analytical data for immature/unripe products were
reported, they were not included in the mean. For crops (e.g. grape and cereals) in which
products (e.g. fruits and grain) are harvested/analysed at different maturity stages, only
analytical results for the mature product (that would have been used as food/feed) were used.
In both the standard weighted and standard unweighted analyses, composition data reported for
different cultivars/varieties and/or years/growing seasons in the same publication were
averaged before being used in the meta-analyses.

Publications were assessed for eligibility and data were independently extracted from them by
two reviewers. Data extracted by the two reviewers were then compared. Discrepancies were
detected for approximately 2 % of the data extracted, and in these cases, data extraction was
repeated to correct mistakes. A list of the publications included in the meta-analyses is given
in Table S2 (available online).

Study characteristics, summaries of the methods used for sensitivity analyses and ancillary
information are given in Tables S2–S10 (available online). These include information on (1) the
number of papers from different countries and publication years used in the meta-analyses (see
online supplementary Figs. S1 and S2); (2) study type, location and crop/products assessed in
different studies (see online supplementary Table S3); (3) the type of material/data extracted
from the papers (see online supplementary Table S4); (4) data-handling methods/inclusion
criteria and meta-analysis methods used in the sensitivity analyses (see online supplementary
Table S5); (5) composition parameters included in the meta-analyses (see online supplementary
Table S6); and (6) composition parameters for which meta-analyses were not possible
(n< 3; see online supplementary Table S7).

Table S8 (available online) summarises basic statistics on the number of studies, individual
comparisons, organic and conventional sample sizes, and comparisons showing statistically or
numerically higher concentrations in organic or conventional crops for the composition
parameters included in Figs. 3 and ​and4.4. Tables S9 and S10 (available online) summarise the numerical values for
the mean percentage differences (MPD) and 95 % CI calculated using the data included in the
standard unweighted and weighted meta-analyses of composition parameters shown in Figs. 3 and ​and4,
respectively4,
respectively (where MPD are shown as symbols).

Meta-analyses

A total of eight different meta-analyses were undertaken. The protocols used for the standard
weighted and unweighted meta-analyses were based on the methodologies described by Palupi
et al.
(

29

) and Brandt et al.
(

20

), respectively. In Fig. 3, the results
obtained using standard random-effects meta-analysis weighted by inverse variance and a common
random-effects variance component and unweighted meta-analysis of difference in means are
shown. In addition, six sensitivity analyses were undertaken. Sensitivity analyses included (1)
using data reported for each cultivar or variety of crops separately and/or (2) treating data
reported for different years in the same publication as separate events in the weighted or
unweighted meta-analyses (see online supplementary Table S5). The results of the sensitivity
analyses are available on the Newcastle University website (http://research.ncl.ac.uk/nefg/QOF).

Effect sizes for all the weighted meta-analyses were based on standardised mean differences
(SMD) as recommended for studies in which data obtained by measuring the same parameters on
different scales are included in meta-analyses(

25

,

26

).

Both weighted and unweighted meta-analyses were carried out using the R statistical
programming environment(

30

). Weighted meta-analyses, with the SMD as the basic response variable, were
conducted using standard methods and the open-source ‘metafor’ statistical package(

31

–

34

). A detailed description of the methods and calculations used is given in the
‘Additional Methods Description’ section in the online supplementary material.

A positive SMD value indicates that the mean concentrations of the observed compound are
greater in the organic food samples, while a negative SMD indicates that the mean
concentrations are higher in the conventional food samples. The statistical significance of a
reported effect size (i.e. SMDtot) and CI were estimated based on standard
methods(

35

) using ‘metafor’(

31

). The influence of potential moderators, such as crop/food type (fruits,
vegetables, cereals, oil seeds and pulses, herbs and spices, and crop-based compound foods),
was additionally tested using mixed-effect models(

36

) and subgroup analyses.

We carried out tests of homogeneity (Q statistics and I
2 statistics) on all the summary effect sizes. Homogeneity was indicated if
I
2 was less than 25 % and the P value for the Q
statistics was greater than 0·010. Funnel plots, Egger tests of funnel plot asymmetry and
fail-safe number tests were used to assess publication bias(

37

) (see online supplementary Table S13 for further information).

For the unweighted meta-analysis, the ratio of organic means:conventional means () expressed as a percentage was ln-transformed, and the values were used to
determine whether the arithmetic average of the ln-transformed ratios was significantly greater
than ln(100), using resampling(

38

). The reported P values were derived from Fisher's one-sample
randomisation test(

39

), and a P< 0·05 was considered statistically significant.
For all composition parameters for which a statistically significant difference between organic
and conventional food samples was detected in the standard weighted analysis (analysis 1),
forest plots were constructed to show SMD and corresponding 95 % CI for individual studies and
types of foods (see Fig. 4 and online supplementary
Figs. S5–S41). In addition, the results of the standard unweighted analyses are shown in Figs. 3 and ​and44.

Table S12 (available online) summarises the results of the standard weighted and unweighted
meta-analyses for all the composition parameters for which no analyses detected significant
differences between organic and conventional products.

MPD were calculated for all parameters for which significant effects were detected by the
standard unweighted and/or weighted meta-analysis protocols. This was done to facilitate value
judgements regarding the biological importance of the relative effect magnitudes. A detailed
description of the calculations is given in the ‘Additional Methods Description’ section in the
online supplementary material.

We also calculated MPD using only data pairs included in the weighted meta-analyses to
estimate the impact of excluding data for which no measures of variance were reported on the
magnitude of difference. As the MPD can be expressed as ‘% higher’ in conventional or organic
crops, they provide estimates for the magnitude of composition differences that are easier to
correlate with existing information on the potential health impacts of changing dietary intake
levels for individual or groups of compounds than the SMD values. The 95 % CI for MPD were
estimated using a standard method(

35

).

For some composition parameters, individual effect sizes were more than fifty times greater
than the pooled effect. This applied to one effect size each for phenolic acids, flavanones,
flavones, flavonols, carbohydrates, DM and ; four effect sizes for carotenoids and xanthophylls; eight effect sizes for
amino acids; and forty-one effect sizes for volatile compounds. Such large differences can be
considered biologically implausible, and these ‘outlier’ data pairs were therefore omitted from
the final standard meta-analyses as shown in Figs. 3 and
​and44 and Tables S10 and S11 (available online).

Data reported for the frequency of occurrence of detectable pesticide residues (percentage of
samples with detectable pesticide residues) in organic and conventional crops were compared
using a weighted meta-analysis protocol based on the ln-transformed OR(

40

). The formula used to calculate OR is given in the ‘Additional Methods Description’
section in the online supplementary material.

An overall assessment of the strength of evidence was made using an adaptation of the GRADE
(Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system(

41

).

Demand for organic foods is partially driven by consumers' perceptions that they are more
nutritious. However, scientific opinion is divided on whether there are significant nutritional
differences between organic and non-organic foods, and two recent reviews have concluded that
there are no differences. In the present study, we carried out meta-analyses based on 343
peer-reviewed publications that indicate statistically significant and meaningful differences
in composition between organic and non-organic crops/crop-based foods. Most importantly, the
concentrations of a range of antioxidants such as polyphenolics were found to be substantially
higher in organic crops/crop-based foods, with those of phenolic acids, flavanones, stilbenes,
flavones, flavonols and anthocyanins being an estimated 19 (95 % CI 5, 33) %, 69 (95 % CI 13,
125) %, 28 (95 % CI 12, 44) %, 26 (95 % CI 3, 48) %, 50 (95 % CI 28, 72) % and 51 (95 % CI 17,
86) % higher, respectively. Many of these compounds have previously been linked to a reduced
risk of chronic diseases, including CVD and neurodegenerative diseases and certain cancers, in
dietary intervention and epidemiological studies. Additionally, the frequency of occurrence of
pesticide residues was found to be four times higher in conventional crops, which also
contained significantly higher concentrations of the toxic metal Cd. Significant differences
were also detected for some other (e.g. minerals and vitamins) compounds. There is evidence
that higher antioxidant concentrations and lower Cd concentrations are linked to specific
agronomic practices (e.g. non-use of mineral N and P fertilisers, respectively) prescribed in
organic farming systems. In conclusion, organic crops, on average, have higher concentrations
of antioxidants, lower concentrations of Cd and a lower incidence of pesticide residues than
the non-organic comparators across regions and production seasons.

Increased public concerns about the negative environmental and health impacts of agrochemicals
(pesticides, growth regulators and mineral fertilisers) used in crop production have been major
drivers for the increase in consumer demand for organic foods over the last 20 years(

1

–

3

).

Organic crop production standards prohibit the use of synthetic chemical crop protection
products and certain mineral fertilisers (all N, KCl and superphosphate) to reduce environmental
impacts (nitrate () leaching and P run-off and pesticide contamination of groundwater) and the
risk of pesticide residues being present in crop plants(

4

). Instead, they prescribe regular inputs of organic fertilisers (e.g. manure and
composts), use of legume crops in rotation (to increase soil N levels), and application of
preventative and non-chemical crop protection methods (e.g. the use of crop rotation, more
resistant/tolerant varieties, mechanical and flame weeding, and biological disease and pest
control products). However, organic standards permit the use of certain plant or microbial
extract and/or mineral (e.g. Cu- and S-based) crop protection products(

5

,

6

).

As a result, organic and conventional crop production may differ significantly in crop rotation
designs and fertilisation and crop protection protocols as well as in the type of crop varieties
used(

6

–

10

). Apart from minimising the risk of agrochemical residues being present in crops, the
agronomic protocols used in organic farming systems may also affect mineral uptake patterns and
metabolic processes in crop plants. Recent studies have shown that the switch from mineral to
organic fertilisers results in significant differences in gene and protein expression patterns
and, as a result, in secondary metabolite profiles; for example, approximately 10 % of proteins
have been found to be either up- or down-regulated in response to contrasting fertiliser inputs
in potato and wheat(

10

–

15

). Also, a switch from pesticide-based conventional to organic crop protection
protocols has been shown to have a significant, but more limited effect than fertilisation
regimens, and there were some statistically significant interactions between fertilisation and
crop protection protocols with respect to gene and protein expression pattern(

10

–

15

).

Over the last 20 years, a large number of scientific studies have compared the concentrations
of nutritionally relevant minerals (e.g. Fe, Zn, Cu and Se), toxic metals (e.g. Cd and Pb),
pesticide residues, macronutrients (e.g. proteins, fats and carbohydrates) and secondary
metabolites (e.g. antioxidants, (poly)phenolics and vitamins) in crops from organic and
conventional production systems (see the online supplementary material for a list of
publications).

There is particular interest in antioxidant activity/concentrations, as there is strong
scientific evidence for health benefits associated with increased consumption of crops rich in
(poly)phenolics and other plant secondary metabolites with antioxidant activity (e.g. carotenoids
and vitamins C and E)(

16

–

18

). Most importantly, a substantial number of human dietary intervention studies have
reported an increased dietary intake of antioxidant/(poly)phenolic-rich foods to protect against
chronic diseases, including CVD, certain cancers (e.g. prostate cancer) and neurodegenerative
diseases; a detailed description of the evidence has been given in recent reviews by Del Rio
et al.
(

16

) and Wahlqvist(

17

). Also, these plant secondary metabolites are increasingly being recognised to
contribute significantly to the health benefits associated with increased fruit, vegetable and
whole grain consumption(

16

–

18

).

Several systematic literature reviews have recently analysed the available published
information, using both qualitative and quantitative methods, with the aim of identifying the
potential effects of organic and conventional production protocols on the nutritional quality of
crops(

19

–

21

). However, these systematic reviews (1) used different methodologies (e.g. weighted
and unweighted meta-analyses) and inclusion criteria, (2) did not cover most of the large amount
of information published in the last 4–5 years, (3) provided no structured assessment of the
strength of the evidence presented, and (4) came to contrasting conclusions. As a result, there
is still considerable controversy as to whether the use of organic production standards results
in significant and consistent changes in the concentrations of potentially health-promoting (e.g.
antioxidants, (poly)phenolics, vitamins and certain minerals) and potentially harmful (e.g. Cd
and Pb) compounds in crops and crop-based foods(

7

,

19

–

22

). However, there is increasing evidence and more widespread acceptance that the
consumption of organic foods is likely to reduce exposure to pesticide residues(

21

,

23

,

24

).

There are major research synthesis challenges to assessing differences in crop composition
resulting from farming practices. Most importantly, the studies available for meta-analyses (1)
have used different experimental designs (e.g. replicated field experiments, farm surveys and
retail surveys) and (2) have been carried out in countries/regions with contrasting agronomic and
pedo-climatic background conditions (see the online supplementary material for a list of
publications). This heterogeneity is likely to increase the amount of published data required to
detect and understand variation in composition parameters resulting from the use of contrasting
crop production methods. An additional problem is that many studies do not report measures of
variation, which reduces the within-study power of unweighted analyses and the between-study
power of weighted analyses. Weighted meta-analyses are widely regarded as the most appropriate
statistical approach for comparing data sets from studies with variable experimental
designs(

25

,

26

). However, some studies have used unweighted analytical methods(

19

) to avoid the loss of information associated with conducting weighted meta-analyses
on a subset of the available information.

Therefore, the main objectives of the present study were to (1) carry out a systematic
literature review of studies focused on quantifying composition differences between organic and
conventional crops, (2) conduct weighted and unweighted meta-analyses of the published data, (3)
carry out sensitivity analyses focused on identifying to what extent meta-analysis results are
affected by the inclusion criteria (e.g. using mean or individual data reported for different
crop varieties or experimental years) and meta-analysis method (e.g. weighted v.
unweighted), and (4) discuss meta-analysis results in the context of the current knowledge about
the nutritional impacts of compounds for which significant composition differences were detected.

The present study specifically focused on plant secondary metabolites (especially
antioxidants/(poly)phenolics and vitamins), potentially harmful synthetic chemical pesticides,
toxic metals (including Cd, As and Pb), , nitrite (), macronutrients (including proteins, amino acids, carbohydrates and reducing
sugars) and minerals (including all plant macro- and micronutrients). Metabolites produced by
micro-organisms on plants (e.g. mycotoxins) were not the subject of the present systematic
literature review and meta-analyses.

The literature search strategy and meta-analysis protocols used were based on those
previously published by Brandt et al.
(

27

), and flow diagrams of the protocols used are shown in Figs. 1 and ​and2.2. Relevant publications
were identified through an initial search of the literature with Web of Knowledge using the
following search terms: (1) organic* or ecologic* or biodynamic*; (2) conventional* or
integrated; (3) names of ninety-eight relevant crops and foods (see online supplementary Table
S1 for a full list). Publications in all languages, published in peer-reviewed journals, and
reporting data on both desirable and undesirable composition parameters were considered
relevant for inclusion in the meta-analyses. The search was restricted to the period between
January 1992 (the year when legally binding organic farming regulations were first introduced
in the European Union) and December 2011 (the year when the project ended) and provided 17 333
references. An additional 208 publications (published between 1977 and 2011) were found by (1)
studying lists of references or (2) directly contacting the authors of the published papers and
reviews identified in the initial literature search. The abstracts of all publications were
then examined to determine whether they contained original data obtained by comparing
composition parameters in organic and conventional plant foods. This led to the identification
of 448 suitable publications. Of these, 105 papers were subsequently rejected, because reading
of the full papers indicated that they did not report suitable data sets or contained the same
data as other studies.



Summary of the search and selection protocols used to identify papers included in the
meta-analyses. * Review carried out by one reviewer; † Data extraction carried out by two
reviewers. CF, comparison of matched farms; BS, basket studies; EX, controlled field

Data sets were deemed suitable if the mean concentrations of at least one mineral,
macronutrient, secondary metabolite or / or the frequency of occurrence of pesticide residues in organic and
conventional crops or crop-based foods were reported. Only four non-peer-reviewed papers with
suitable data sets were identified but subsequently rejected, as the small number minimised any
potential bias(

28

) from using peer review as a ‘quality’ selection criterion.

As a result, 343 peer-reviewed publications reporting crop composition data were selected for
data extraction, of which 156 references fulfilled the criteria for inclusion in the standard
weighted meta-analysis and 343 fulfilled the criteria for inclusion in the standard unweighted
meta-analysis. This represents a significantly greater evidence base than the three previous
systematic reviews/meta-analyses of comparative crop composition data(

19

–

21

). All publications included in these previous reviews (including studies published
before 1992) were also used in the standard weighted meta-analysis carried out in the present
study, except for a small number of papers that were found to report the same data as other
publications that had already been included.

Data were extracted from three types of comparative studies: (1) comparisons of matched farms
(CF), farm surveys in which samples were collected from organic and conventional farms in the
same country or region; (2) basket studies (BS), retail product surveys in which organic and
conventional products were collected in retail outlets; (3) controlled field experiments (EX)
in which samples were collected from experimental plots managed according to organic or
conventional farming standards/protocols. Data from all the three types of studies were deemed
relevant for the meta-analyses if the authors stated that (1) organic farms included in farm
surveys were using organic farming methods, (2) organic products collected in retail surveys
were labelled as organic, and (3) organic plots used in EX were managed according to organic
farming standards.

Several studies compared more than one organic or conventional system or treatment. For
example, additional conventional systems/treatments were described as ‘integrated,’ ‘low
input,’ ‘low fertility’ or ‘extensive’, and an additional organic system/treatment included in
some studies was described as ‘biodynamic’. Also, in some publications, organic or conventional
systems with contrasting rotation designs (e.g. with or without cover crops) or fertilisation
regimens (different types and levels of N inputs) were compared. In such cases, only the
organic and conventional (non-organic) system identified by the authors as closest to the
typical, contemporary organic/conventional farming system was used in the meta-analyses, as
recommended by Brandt et al.
(

20

). Full references of the publications and a summary of descriptions of the studies
included in the meta-analyses are given in Tables S2 and S4 (available online).

The database generated and used for the meta-analyses will be made freely available on the
Newcastle University website (http://research.ncl.ac.uk/nefg/QOF) for use and scrutiny by
others.

Information and data were extracted from all the selected publications (see above) and
compiled in a Microsoft Access database. A list of the information extracted from the
publications and recorded in the database is given in Table S4 (available online).

Data reported as numerical values in the text or tables were copied directly into the
database. Only data published in graphical form were enlarged, printed, measured (using a
ruler) and then entered into the database as described previously(

20

).

Where data for multiple time points were reported, two approaches were used, depending on
whether the analysed crop tissue was likely to be used as food/feed. For crops that are
continuously harvested (e.g. tomato and cucumber), analytical data for mature/ripe products
(e.g. fruits) collected at multiple time points during the season were averaged before being
used in the standard meta-analyses; if analytical data for immature/unripe products were
reported, they were not included in the mean. For crops (e.g. grape and cereals) in which
products (e.g. fruits and grain) are harvested/analysed at different maturity stages, only
analytical results for the mature product (that would have been used as food/feed) were used.
In both the standard weighted and standard unweighted analyses, composition data reported for
different cultivars/varieties and/or years/growing seasons in the same publication were
averaged before being used in the meta-analyses.

Publications were assessed for eligibility and data were independently extracted from them by
two reviewers. Data extracted by the two reviewers were then compared. Discrepancies were
detected for approximately 2 % of the data extracted, and in these cases, data extraction was
repeated to correct mistakes. A list of the publications included in the meta-analyses is given
in Table S2 (available online).

Study characteristics, summaries of the methods used for sensitivity analyses and ancillary
information are given in Tables S2–S10 (available online). These include information on (1) the
number of papers from different countries and publication years used in the meta-analyses (see
online supplementary Figs. S1 and S2); (2) study type, location and crop/products assessed in
different studies (see online supplementary Table S3); (3) the type of material/data extracted
from the papers (see online supplementary Table S4); (4) data-handling methods/inclusion
criteria and meta-analysis methods used in the sensitivity analyses (see online supplementary
Table S5); (5) composition parameters included in the meta-analyses (see online supplementary
Table S6); and (6) composition parameters for which meta-analyses were not possible
(n< 3; see online supplementary Table S7).

Table S8 (available online) summarises basic statistics on the number of studies, individual
comparisons, organic and conventional sample sizes, and comparisons showing statistically or
numerically higher concentrations in organic or conventional crops for the composition
parameters included in Figs. 3 and ​and4.4. Tables S9 and S10 (available online) summarise the numerical values for
the mean percentage differences (MPD) and 95 % CI calculated using the data included in the
standard unweighted and weighted meta-analyses of composition parameters shown in Figs. 3 and ​and4,
respectively4,
respectively (where MPD are shown as symbols).

A total of eight different meta-analyses were undertaken. The protocols used for the standard
weighted and unweighted meta-analyses were based on the methodologies described by Palupi
et al.
(

29

) and Brandt et al.
(

20

), respectively. In Fig. 3, the results
obtained using standard random-effects meta-analysis weighted by inverse variance and a common
random-effects variance component and unweighted meta-analysis of difference in means are
shown. In addition, six sensitivity analyses were undertaken. Sensitivity analyses included (1)
using data reported for each cultivar or variety of crops separately and/or (2) treating data
reported for different years in the same publication as separate events in the weighted or
unweighted meta-analyses (see online supplementary Table S5). The results of the sensitivity
analyses are available on the Newcastle University website (http://research.ncl.ac.uk/nefg/QOF).

Effect sizes for all the weighted meta-analyses were based on standardised mean differences
(SMD) as recommended for studies in which data obtained by measuring the same parameters on
different scales are included in meta-analyses(

25

,

26

).

Both weighted and unweighted meta-analyses were carried out using the R statistical
programming environment(

30

). Weighted meta-analyses, with the SMD as the basic response variable, were
conducted using standard methods and the open-source ‘metafor’ statistical package(

31

–

34

). A detailed description of the methods and calculations used is given in the
‘Additional Methods Description’ section in the online supplementary material.

A positive SMD value indicates that the mean concentrations of the observed compound are
greater in the organic food samples, while a negative SMD indicates that the mean
concentrations are higher in the conventional food samples. The statistical significance of a
reported effect size (i.e. SMDtot) and CI were estimated based on standard
methods(

35

) using ‘metafor’(

31

). The influence of potential moderators, such as crop/food type (fruits,
vegetables, cereals, oil seeds and pulses, herbs and spices, and crop-based compound foods),
was additionally tested using mixed-effect models(

36

) and subgroup analyses.

We carried out tests of homogeneity (Q statistics and I
2 statistics) on all the summary effect sizes. Homogeneity was indicated if
I
2 was less than 25 % and the P value for the Q
statistics was greater than 0·010. Funnel plots, Egger tests of funnel plot asymmetry and
fail-safe number tests were used to assess publication bias(

37

) (see online supplementary Table S13 for further information).

For the unweighted meta-analysis, the ratio of organic means:conventional means () expressed as a percentage was ln-transformed, and the values were used to
determine whether the arithmetic average of the ln-transformed ratios was significantly greater
than ln(100), using resampling(

38

). The reported P values were derived from Fisher's one-sample
randomisation test(

39

), and a P< 0·05 was considered statistically significant.
For all composition parameters for which a statistically significant difference between organic
and conventional food samples was detected in the standard weighted analysis (analysis 1),
forest plots were constructed to show SMD and corresponding 95 % CI for individual studies and
types of foods (see Fig. 4 and online supplementary
Figs. S5–S41). In addition, the results of the standard unweighted analyses are shown in Figs. 3 and ​and44.

Table S12 (available online) summarises the results of the standard weighted and unweighted
meta-analyses for all the composition parameters for which no analyses detected significant
differences between organic and conventional products.

MPD were calculated for all parameters for which significant effects were detected by the
standard unweighted and/or weighted meta-analysis protocols. This was done to facilitate value
judgements regarding the biological importance of the relative effect magnitudes. A detailed
description of the calculations is given in the ‘Additional Methods Description’ section in the
online supplementary material.

We also calculated MPD using only data pairs included in the weighted meta-analyses to
estimate the impact of excluding data for which no measures of variance were reported on the
magnitude of difference. As the MPD can be expressed as ‘% higher’ in conventional or organic
crops, they provide estimates for the magnitude of composition differences that are easier to
correlate with existing information on the potential health impacts of changing dietary intake
levels for individual or groups of compounds than the SMD values. The 95 % CI for MPD were
estimated using a standard method(

35

).

For some composition parameters, individual effect sizes were more than fifty times greater
than the pooled effect. This applied to one effect size each for phenolic acids, flavanones,
flavones, flavonols, carbohydrates, DM and ; four effect sizes for carotenoids and xanthophylls; eight effect sizes for
amino acids; and forty-one effect sizes for volatile compounds. Such large differences can be
considered biologically implausible, and these ‘outlier’ data pairs were therefore omitted from
the final standard meta-analyses as shown in Figs. 3 and
​and44 and Tables S10 and S11 (available online).

Data reported for the frequency of occurrence of detectable pesticide residues (percentage of
samples with detectable pesticide residues) in organic and conventional crops were compared
using a weighted meta-analysis protocol based on the ln-transformed OR(

40

). The formula used to calculate OR is given in the ‘Additional Methods Description’
section in the online supplementary material.

An overall assessment of the strength of evidence was made using an adaptation of the GRADE
(Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system(

41

).

Analyses were based on data from publications reporting results from EX (154 papers), CF (116
papers), and BS (fifty-five papers) or results from more than one type of study (EX, CF and/or
BS; eighteen papers) (see online supplementary Table S3).

Approximately 70 % of all the studies included in the meta-analyses were carried out in
Europe, mainly in Italy, Spain, Poland, Sweden, the Czech Republic, Switzerland, Turkey,
Denmark, Finland and Germany, with most of the remaining studies being carried out in the USA,
Brazil, Canada and Japan (see online supplementary Table S3 and Fig. S2). Among the papers
included in the meta-analyses, 174 reported comparison data for vegetables and a smaller number
reported data for fruits and cereals (112 and sixty-one, respectively), while only thirty-seven
reported data for other crops/crop-based food products (e.g. oil seeds and pulses, herbs and
spices, and compound foods) (see online supplementary Table S3). Publications reported data for
907 different composition parameters, of which 182 were included in the meta-analyses (see
online supplementary Tables S6 and S7).
Antioxidant activity

A large number of comparisons were available for antioxidant activity in organic and
conventional crops (160 for the unweighted meta-analysis and sixty-six for the weighted
meta-analysis), but the authors used a wide range of different methodologies. Both weighted and
unweighted meta-analyses detected a significantly higher antioxidant activity in organic crops
(Fig. 3) and the MPD was 17 (95 % CI 3, 32) % (Fig. 3).

When data reported for fruits and vegetables were analysed separately, a significant
difference was detected for fruits, while only a trend towards a significant difference
(P= 0·06) was observed for vegetables (Fig.
4), although there was no evidence of an interaction.

When data available for specific antioxidant activity assays were analysed, similar results
were obtained for the Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity assay with both the standard
weighted and unweighted meta-analyses and for the ferric reducing antioxidant power and oxygen
radical absorbance capacity assays with only the standard unweighted meta-analysis (Fig. 3).
Antioxidants/(poly)phenolics

The concentrations of secondary metabolites with antioxidant activity, including a wide range
of nutritionally desirable (poly)phenolics, were also studied in a relatively large number of
studies (see online supplementary Table S8).

For (poly)phenolics, the standard weighted meta-analysis detected significantly and
substantially higher concentrations of total flavonoids, total phenolic acids, phenolic acids
(where data reported for all individual phenolic acid compounds were included in the same
analysis), flavanones, stilbenes, flavones, flavonols, kaempferol, total anthocyanins and
anthocyanins in organic crops and/or processed foods made from organic crops. The unweighted
meta-analysis yielded similar results, except for (1) total flavonoids, for which no
significant difference was detected, and (2) flavanones and flavones, for which only trends
towards higher concentrations in organic crops were detected (Fig. 3). The unweighted meta-analysis also detected significantly higher
concentrations of chlorogenic acid (5-O-caffeoylquinic acid) in organic crops
(Fig. 3). The MPD for most of the compounds were
between 18 and 69 % for most of the above-mentioned antioxidant compounds (Fig. 3). Inclusion of data for which no measures of variance were reported
in the calculation of MPD yielded similar values for phenolic compounds, phenolic acids,
chlorogenic acid, flavones, quercetin, kaempferol and anthocyanins; higher values for phenolic
acids (total), stilbenes and quercetin-3-rutinoside; and lower values for flavonoids,
flavanones and flavonols (see Fig. 4 and online
supplementary Table S9).

When data reported for phenolic compounds, phenolic acids and flavanones in fruits,
vegetables, cereals and/or processed crop-based foods were analysed separately, significant
differences were detected only for the concentrations of phenolic compounds and phenolic acids
in fruits and a trend towards a significant difference (P= 0·09) was detected
for the concentrations of flavanones in fruits (Fig. 4),
although there was no evidence of an interaction. In contrast, when differences in the
concentrations of flavones and flavonols were analysed separately for fruits, vegetables and
cereals, significant differences were detected for vegetables and cereals, but not for fruits,
with evidence of interactions (Fig. 4). For all other
antioxidant/(poly)phenolic compounds, separate analyses for different crop types were not
possible due to the unavailability of sufficient data.

Smaller, but statistically significant and biologically meaningful composition differences
were also detected for a small number of carotenoids and vitamins. Both unweighted and weighted
meta-analyses detected significantly higher concentrations of xanthophylls and
l-ascorbic acid and significantly lower concentrations of vitamin E in organic crops.
Higher concentrations of total carotenoids, carotenoids (where data reported for all individual
phenolic acid compounds were included in the same analysis) and lutein were also detected by
the unweighted meta-analysis (Fig. 3). The MPD were 17
(95 % CI 0, 34) % for total carotenoids, 15 (95 % CI − 3, 32) % for carotenoids (where data
reported for all individual carotenoid compounds were included in the same analysis), 12 (95 %
CI − 4, 28) % for xanthophylls, 5 (95 % CI − 3, 13) % for lutein, 6 (95 % CI − 3, 15) % for
vitamin C and − 15 (95 % CI − 49, 19) % for vitamin E. Inclusion of data for which no measures
of variance were reported in the calculation of MPD resulted in slightly higher values (see
Fig. 4 and online supplementary Table S9).

When data reported for total carotenoids and xanthophylls in fruits, vegetables, cereals and
processed crop-based compound foods were analysed separately, significantly higher
concentrations in organic samples were detected only for fruits (Fig. 4), with evidence of interactions being detected for carotenoids, but
not for xanthophylls.

The meta-analyses did not detect significant differences for a range of other secondary
metabolites with antioxidant activity. These included some individual carotenoids (α-carotene,
lycopene, β-cryptoxanthin and zeaxanthin), vitamins (α-tocopherol, γ-tocopherol, vitamin B and
vitamin B1), some specific phenolic acids (total hydroxycinnamic acids, caffeic
acid, p-coumaric acid, ferulic acid, sinapic acid,
5-O-caffeoylquinic acid, ellagic acid, gallic acid and salicylic acid), some
specific flavones and flavonols (apigenin, luteolin, myricetin 3-O-glucoside,
quercetin 3-O-galactoside, quercetin-3-O-glucoside and
quercetin-3-O-malonyl glucoside) and some specific flavanones (naringenin and
naringenin (R-enantiomer)).
Macronutrients, fibre and DM content

Both unweighted and weighted meta-analyses detected significantly higher concentrations of
total carbohydrates and significantly lower concentrations of proteins, amino acids and fibre
in organic crops/crop-based compound foods (Fig. 3). The
unweighted meta-analysis also detected significantly higher concentrations of reducing sugars
and DM in organic crops (Fig. 4). The MPD were 25 (95 %
CI 5, 45) % for total carbohydrates, 11 (95 % CI 2, 20) % for carbohydrates (where data
reported for all individual phenolic acid compounds were included in the same analysis), 7
(95 % CI 4, 11) % for reducing sugars, − 15 (95 % CI − 27, − 3) % for proteins, − 11 (95 % CI
− 14, − 8) % for amino acids, 2 (95 % CI − 1, 6) % for DM and − 8 (95 % CI − 14, − 2) % for
fibre. Inclusion of data for which no measures of variance were reported in the calculation of
MPD resulted in similar values for carbohydrates, proteins, DM and fibre; higher values for
reducing sugars; and lower values for carbohydrates (total) and amino acids (see Fig. 4 and online supplementary Table S9).

When data reported for proteins and amino acids in vegetables, cereals and/or processed
crop-based foods were analysed separately, significant differences were detected for cereals
and processed crop-based foods, but not for vegetables (Fig.
4), although there was no evidence of an interaction. Also, when data reported for
carbohydrates in vegetables, fruits and cereals were analysed separately, no significant
effects could be detected in their concentrations (Fig.
4).
Toxic metals, nitrogen, nitrate, nitrite and pesticides

Both weighted and unweighted meta-analyses detected significantly lower concentrations of the
toxic metal Cd and total N in organic crops, while lower concentrations of  and  in organic crops were detected only by the unweighted meta-analysis (Fig. 3). The MPD were − 48 (95 % CI − 112, 16) % for Cd, − 10
(95 % CI − 15, − 4) % for N, − 30 (95 % CI − 144, 84) % for  and − 87 (95 % CI − 225, 52) % for  (Fig. 3).

Inclusion of data for which no measures of variance were reported in the calculation of MPD
resulted in similar values for N, ,  and Cd (see Fig. 4 and online
supplementary Table S9).

When data reported for N and Cd concentrations in fruits, vegetables and cereals were
analysed separately, significant differences were detected for cereals, but not for vegetables
and/or fruits (Fig. 4), although there was no evidence
of an interaction.

For the toxic metals As and Pb, no significant differences could be detected in their
concentrations between organic and conventional crops in the meta-analyses (see online
supplementary Table S12).

The standard meta-analyses showed that the frequency of occurrence of detectable pesticide
residues was four times higher in conventional crops (46 (95 % CI 38, 55) %) than in organic
crops (11 (95 % CI 7, 14) %) (Fig. 5). Significantly
higher frequencies of occurrence of pesticide residues in conventional crops were also detected
when data reported for fruits, vegetables and processed crop-based foods were analysed
separately (Fig. 5). Conventional fruits had a higher
frequency (75 (95 % CI 65, 85) %) of occurrence of pesticide residues than vegetables (32 (95 %
CI 22, 43) %) and crop-based compound foods (45 (95 % CI 25, 65) %), while contamination rates
were very similar in the different organic crop types. This resulted in significant differences
in the OR for different crop types (Fig. 5).

Other minerals

For most of the minerals (including many plant marco- and micronutrients), the meta-analyses
could not detect significant composition differences between organic and conventional crops
(see online supplementary Table S12). However, for a small number of minerals, differences in
composition were identified by both weighted and unweighted meta-analyses, which detected
significantly lower concentrations of Cr and Sr ( − 59 (95 % CI − 147, 30) % and − 26 (95 % CI
− 45, − 6) %, respectively), but significantly higher concentrations of Mo and Rb (65 (95 % CI
26, 105) % and 82 (95 % CI 6, 157) %, respectively) in organic crops. Also, lower
concentrations of Mn ( − 8 (95 % CI − 13, − 3) %) and higher concentrations of Ga and Mg in
organic crops (57 (95 % CI − 122, 8) % and 4 (95 % CI − 5, 13) %, respectively) were detected
only by the weighted meta-analysis, while slightly higher concentrations of Zn (5 (95 % CI − 6,
15) %) in organic crops were only detected by the unweighted meta-analysis (see online
supplementary Table S11). As differences for Zn and Mg were relatively small and as there is
limited information about potential health impacts associated with changing intake levels of
either mineral (Cr, Ga, Mo, Sr and Mo), more detailed results are provided only in the online
supplementary material.
Effects of crop type/species/variety, study type and other sources of variation

Heterogeneity was extremely high (I
2>75 %) for most of the composition parameters, with I
2 ranging from 76 % for ascorbic acid to 100 % for carotenoids and DM (Fig. 3). The only exceptions were vitamin E, reducing sugars,
fibre and , for which the small number of studies and/or high within-study variability
limited the ability to distinguish heterogeneity between the effects.

Strong or moderate funnel plot asymmetry consistent with a publication bias was detected for
approximately half of the parameters. However, it is not possible to definitively attribute
discrepancies between large precise studies and small imprecise studies to publication bias,
which remains strongly suspected rather than detected where asymmetry is severe (see Table 1 and online supplementary Table S13).


GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessments, Development and Evaluation) assessment of
the strength of evidence for standard weighted meta-analysis for parameters included in
Fig. 3 (Standardised mean difference values (SMD)
and 95 % confidence intervals)

FRAP, ferric reducing antioxidant potential; ORAC, oxygen radical absorbance capacity;
TEAC, Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity.

When meta-analysis results obtained from different study types (BS, CF and EX) were compared,
similar results were obtained for most of the composition parameters included in Fig. 3 (see online supplementary Figs. S3 and S4). However,
there was considerable variation between results obtained for different crop types, crop
species, and/or studies carried out in countries with contrasting pedo-climatic and agronomic
background conditions (see Fig. 4 and online
supplementary Figs. S5–S41).

Non-weighted MPD were calculated to aid in the biological interpretation of effect size
magnitude where either the weighted or unweighted meta-analysis had identified statistically
significant results. For many parameters, MPD based on all the available data produced values
very similar to those calculated using only data for which measures of variance were reported
( = those used for the weighted meta-analysis; Fig. 3).
However, for other parameters (flavonoids, total phenolic acids, flavanones, rutin,
l-ascorbic acid, reducing sugars and Cd), inclusion criteria had a large effect on the
MPD.

Also, when the calculated MPD were superimposed onto SMD (with 95 % CI) results at an
appropriate scale ( − 100 to +100 for MPD and − 5 to +5 for SMD), a reasonable match was
observed, with MPD for most of the compounds being present within the 95 % CI for SMD (Fig. 3). However, for some parameters (Trolox equivalent
antioxidant capacity, total phenolic acids, stilbenes, rutin, total carotenoids,
l-ascorbic acid, vitamin E, reducing sugars, proteins, ,  and Cd), MPD were outside the 95 % CI of SMD, and therefore these should be
seen as less reliable.

For the composition parameters included in Fig. 3,
sensitivity analyses, which were based on different inclusion criteria and data-handling
methods, yielded results broadly similar to those yielded by the standard weighted and
unweighted meta-analyses.

The overall assessment of the strength of evidence using an adapted GRADE(

41

) approach highlighted uncertainties in the evidence base, but the overall strength
of evidence was moderate or high for the majority of parameters for which significant
differences were detected (see Table 1 and online
supplementary Table S13).

Demand for organic foods is partially driven by consumers' perceptions that they are more
nutritious. However, scientific opinion is divided on whether there are significant nutritional
differences between organic and non-organic foods, and two recent reviews have concluded that
there are no differences. In the present study, we carried out meta-analyses based on 343
peer-reviewed publications that indicate statistically significant and meaningful differences
in composition between organic and non-organic crops/crop-based foods. Most importantly, the
concentrations of a range of antioxidants such as polyphenolics were found to be substantially
higher in organic crops/crop-based foods, with those of phenolic acids, flavanones, stilbenes,
flavones, flavonols and anthocyanins being an estimated 19 (95 % CI 5, 33) %, 69 (95 % CI 13,
125) %, 28 (95 % CI 12, 44) %, 26 (95 % CI 3, 48) %, 50 (95 % CI 28, 72) % and 51 (95 % CI 17,
86) % higher, respectively. Many of these compounds have previously been linked to a reduced
risk of chronic diseases, including CVD and neurodegenerative diseases and certain cancers, in
dietary intervention and epidemiological studies. Additionally, the frequency of occurrence of
pesticide residues was found to be four times higher in conventional crops, which also
contained significantly higher concentrations of the toxic metal Cd. Significant differences
were also detected for some other (e.g. minerals and vitamins) compounds. There is evidence
that higher antioxidant concentrations and lower Cd concentrations are linked to specific
agronomic practices (e.g. non-use of mineral N and P fertilisers, respectively) prescribed in
organic farming systems. In conclusion, organic crops, on average, have higher concentrations
of antioxidants, lower concentrations of Cd and a lower incidence of pesticide residues than
the non-organic comparators across regions and production seasons.

Increased public concerns about the negative environmental and health impacts of agrochemicals
(pesticides, growth regulators and mineral fertilisers) used in crop production have been major
drivers for the increase in consumer demand for organic foods over the last 20 years(

1

–

3

).

Organic crop production standards prohibit the use of synthetic chemical crop protection
products and certain mineral fertilisers (all N, KCl and superphosphate) to reduce environmental
impacts (nitrate () leaching and P run-off and pesticide contamination of groundwater) and the
risk of pesticide residues being present in crop plants(

4

). Instead, they prescribe regular inputs of organic fertilisers (e.g. manure and
composts), use of legume crops in rotation (to increase soil N levels), and application of
preventative and non-chemical crop protection methods (e.g. the use of crop rotation, more
resistant/tolerant varieties, mechanical and flame weeding, and biological disease and pest
control products). However, organic standards permit the use of certain plant or microbial
extract and/or mineral (e.g. Cu- and S-based) crop protection products(

5

,

6

).

As a result, organic and conventional crop production may differ significantly in crop rotation
designs and fertilisation and crop protection protocols as well as in the type of crop varieties
used(

6

–

10

). Apart from minimising the risk of agrochemical residues being present in crops, the
agronomic protocols used in organic farming systems may also affect mineral uptake patterns and
metabolic processes in crop plants. Recent studies have shown that the switch from mineral to
organic fertilisers results in significant differences in gene and protein expression patterns
and, as a result, in secondary metabolite profiles; for example, approximately 10 % of proteins
have been found to be either up- or down-regulated in response to contrasting fertiliser inputs
in potato and wheat(

10

–

15

). Also, a switch from pesticide-based conventional to organic crop protection
protocols has been shown to have a significant, but more limited effect than fertilisation
regimens, and there were some statistically significant interactions between fertilisation and
crop protection protocols with respect to gene and protein expression pattern(

10

–

15

).

Over the last 20 years, a large number of scientific studies have compared the concentrations
of nutritionally relevant minerals (e.g. Fe, Zn, Cu and Se), toxic metals (e.g. Cd and Pb),
pesticide residues, macronutrients (e.g. proteins, fats and carbohydrates) and secondary
metabolites (e.g. antioxidants, (poly)phenolics and vitamins) in crops from organic and
conventional production systems (see the online supplementary material for a list of
publications).

There is particular interest in antioxidant activity/concentrations, as there is strong
scientific evidence for health benefits associated with increased consumption of crops rich in
(poly)phenolics and other plant secondary metabolites with antioxidant activity (e.g. carotenoids
and vitamins C and E)(

16

–

18

). Most importantly, a substantial number of human dietary intervention studies have
reported an increased dietary intake of antioxidant/(poly)phenolic-rich foods to protect against
chronic diseases, including CVD, certain cancers (e.g. prostate cancer) and neurodegenerative
diseases; a detailed description of the evidence has been given in recent reviews by Del Rio
et al.
(

16

) and Wahlqvist(

17

). Also, these plant secondary metabolites are increasingly being recognised to
contribute significantly to the health benefits associated with increased fruit, vegetable and
whole grain consumption(

16

–

18

).

Several systematic literature reviews have recently analysed the available published
information, using both qualitative and quantitative methods, with the aim of identifying the
potential effects of organic and conventional production protocols on the nutritional quality of
crops(

19

–

21

). However, these systematic reviews (1) used different methodologies (e.g. weighted
and unweighted meta-analyses) and inclusion criteria, (2) did not cover most of the large amount
of information published in the last 4–5 years, (3) provided no structured assessment of the
strength of the evidence presented, and (4) came to contrasting conclusions. As a result, there
is still considerable controversy as to whether the use of organic production standards results
in significant and consistent changes in the concentrations of potentially health-promoting (e.g.
antioxidants, (poly)phenolics, vitamins and certain minerals) and potentially harmful (e.g. Cd
and Pb) compounds in crops and crop-based foods(

7

,

19

–

22

). However, there is increasing evidence and more widespread acceptance that the
consumption of organic foods is likely to reduce exposure to pesticide residues(

21

,

23

,

24

).

There are major research synthesis challenges to assessing differences in crop composition
resulting from farming practices. Most importantly, the studies available for meta-analyses (1)
have used different experimental designs (e.g. replicated field experiments, farm surveys and
retail surveys) and (2) have been carried out in countries/regions with contrasting agronomic and
pedo-climatic background conditions (see the online supplementary material for a list of
publications). This heterogeneity is likely to increase the amount of published data required to
detect and understand variation in composition parameters resulting from the use of contrasting
crop production methods. An additional problem is that many studies do not report measures of
variation, which reduces the within-study power of unweighted analyses and the between-study
power of weighted analyses. Weighted meta-analyses are widely regarded as the most appropriate
statistical approach for comparing data sets from studies with variable experimental
designs(

25

,

26

). However, some studies have used unweighted analytical methods(

19

) to avoid the loss of information associated with conducting weighted meta-analyses
on a subset of the available information.

Therefore, the main objectives of the present study were to (1) carry out a systematic
literature review of studies focused on quantifying composition differences between organic and
conventional crops, (2) conduct weighted and unweighted meta-analyses of the published data, (3)
carry out sensitivity analyses focused on identifying to what extent meta-analysis results are
affected by the inclusion criteria (e.g. using mean or individual data reported for different
crop varieties or experimental years) and meta-analysis method (e.g. weighted v.
unweighted), and (4) discuss meta-analysis results in the context of the current knowledge about
the nutritional impacts of compounds for which significant composition differences were detected.

The present study specifically focused on plant secondary metabolites (especially
antioxidants/(poly)phenolics and vitamins), potentially harmful synthetic chemical pesticides,
toxic metals (including Cd, As and Pb), , nitrite (), macronutrients (including proteins, amino acids, carbohydrates and reducing
sugars) and minerals (including all plant macro- and micronutrients). Metabolites produced by
micro-organisms on plants (e.g. mycotoxins) were not the subject of the present systematic
literature review and meta-analyses.

The literature search strategy and meta-analysis protocols used were based on those
previously published by Brandt et al.
(

27

), and flow diagrams of the protocols used are shown in Figs. 1 and ​and2.2. Relevant publications
were identified through an initial search of the literature with Web of Knowledge using the
following search terms: (1) organic* or ecologic* or biodynamic*; (2) conventional* or
integrated; (3) names of ninety-eight relevant crops and foods (see online supplementary Table
S1 for a full list). Publications in all languages, published in peer-reviewed journals, and
reporting data on both desirable and undesirable composition parameters were considered
relevant for inclusion in the meta-analyses. The search was restricted to the period between
January 1992 (the year when legally binding organic farming regulations were first introduced
in the European Union) and December 2011 (the year when the project ended) and provided 17 333
references. An additional 208 publications (published between 1977 and 2011) were found by (1)
studying lists of references or (2) directly contacting the authors of the published papers and
reviews identified in the initial literature search. The abstracts of all publications were
then examined to determine whether they contained original data obtained by comparing
composition parameters in organic and conventional plant foods. This led to the identification
of 448 suitable publications. Of these, 105 papers were subsequently rejected, because reading
of the full papers indicated that they did not report suitable data sets or contained the same
data as other studies.



Summary of the search and selection protocols used to identify papers included in the
meta-analyses. * Review carried out by one reviewer; † Data extraction carried out by two
reviewers. CF, comparison of matched farms; BS, basket studies; EX, controlled field

Data sets were deemed suitable if the mean concentrations of at least one mineral,
macronutrient, secondary metabolite or / or the frequency of occurrence of pesticide residues in organic and
conventional crops or crop-based foods were reported. Only four non-peer-reviewed papers with
suitable data sets were identified but subsequently rejected, as the small number minimised any
potential bias(

28

) from using peer review as a ‘quality’ selection criterion.

As a result, 343 peer-reviewed publications reporting crop composition data were selected for
data extraction, of which 156 references fulfilled the criteria for inclusion in the standard
weighted meta-analysis and 343 fulfilled the criteria for inclusion in the standard unweighted
meta-analysis. This represents a significantly greater evidence base than the three previous
systematic reviews/meta-analyses of comparative crop composition data(

19

–

21

). All publications included in these previous reviews (including studies published
before 1992) were also used in the standard weighted meta-analysis carried out in the present
study, except for a small number of papers that were found to report the same data as other
publications that had already been included.

Data were extracted from three types of comparative studies: (1) comparisons of matched farms
(CF), farm surveys in which samples were collected from organic and conventional farms in the
same country or region; (2) basket studies (BS), retail product surveys in which organic and
conventional products were collected in retail outlets; (3) controlled field experiments (EX)
in which samples were collected from experimental plots managed according to organic or
conventional farming standards/protocols. Data from all the three types of studies were deemed
relevant for the meta-analyses if the authors stated that (1) organic farms included in farm
surveys were using organic farming methods, (2) organic products collected in retail surveys
were labelled as organic, and (3) organic plots used in EX were managed according to organic
farming standards.

Several studies compared more than one organic or conventional system or treatment. For
example, additional conventional systems/treatments were described as ‘integrated,’ ‘low
input,’ ‘low fertility’ or ‘extensive’, and an additional organic system/treatment included in
some studies was described as ‘biodynamic’. Also, in some publications, organic or conventional
systems with contrasting rotation designs (e.g. with or without cover crops) or fertilisation
regimens (different types and levels of N inputs) were compared. In such cases, only the
organic and conventional (non-organic) system identified by the authors as closest to the
typical, contemporary organic/conventional farming system was used in the meta-analyses, as
recommended by Brandt et al.
(

20

). Full references of the publications and a summary of descriptions of the studies
included in the meta-analyses are given in Tables S2 and S4 (available online).

The database generated and used for the meta-analyses will be made freely available on the
Newcastle University website (http://research.ncl.ac.uk/nefg/QOF) for use and scrutiny by
others.

Information and data were extracted from all the selected publications (see above) and
compiled in a Microsoft Access database. A list of the information extracted from the
publications and recorded in the database is given in Table S4 (available online).

Data reported as numerical values in the text or tables were copied directly into the
database. Only data published in graphical form were enlarged, printed, measured (using a
ruler) and then entered into the database as described previously(

20

).

Where data for multiple time points were reported, two approaches were used, depending on
whether the analysed crop tissue was likely to be used as food/feed. For crops that are
continuously harvested (e.g. tomato and cucumber), analytical data for mature/ripe products
(e.g. fruits) collected at multiple time points during the season were averaged before being
used in the standard meta-analyses; if analytical data for immature/unripe products were
reported, they were not included in the mean. For crops (e.g. grape and cereals) in which
products (e.g. fruits and grain) are harvested/analysed at different maturity stages, only
analytical results for the mature product (that would have been used as food/feed) were used.
In both the standard weighted and standard unweighted analyses, composition data reported for
different cultivars/varieties and/or years/growing seasons in the same publication were
averaged before being used in the meta-analyses.

Publications were assessed for eligibility and data were independently extracted from them by
two reviewers. Data extracted by the two reviewers were then compared. Discrepancies were
detected for approximately 2 % of the data extracted, and in these cases, data extraction was
repeated to correct mistakes. A list of the publications included in the meta-analyses is given
in Table S2 (available online).

Study characteristics, summaries of the methods used for sensitivity analyses and ancillary
information are given in Tables S2–S10 (available online). These include information on (1) the
number of papers from different countries and publication years used in the meta-analyses (see
online supplementary Figs. S1 and S2); (2) study type, location and crop/products assessed in
different studies (see online supplementary Table S3); (3) the type of material/data extracted
from the papers (see online supplementary Table S4); (4) data-handling methods/inclusion
criteria and meta-analysis methods used in the sensitivity analyses (see online supplementary
Table S5); (5) composition parameters included in the meta-analyses (see online supplementary
Table S6); and (6) composition parameters for which meta-analyses were not possible
(n< 3; see online supplementary Table S7).

Table S8 (available online) summarises basic statistics on the number of studies, individual
comparisons, organic and conventional sample sizes, and comparisons showing statistically or
numerically higher concentrations in organic or conventional crops for the composition
parameters included in Figs. 3 and ​and4.4. Tables S9 and S10 (available online) summarise the numerical values for
the mean percentage differences (MPD) and 95 % CI calculated using the data included in the
standard unweighted and weighted meta-analyses of composition parameters shown in Figs. 3 and ​and4,
respectively4,
respectively (where MPD are shown as symbols).

A total of eight different meta-analyses were undertaken. The protocols used for the standard
weighted and unweighted meta-analyses were based on the methodologies described by Palupi
et al.
(

29

) and Brandt et al.
(

20

), respectively. In Fig. 3, the results
obtained using standard random-effects meta-analysis weighted by inverse variance and a common
random-effects variance component and unweighted meta-analysis of difference in means are
shown. In addition, six sensitivity analyses were undertaken. Sensitivity analyses included (1)
using data reported for each cultivar or variety of crops separately and/or (2) treating data
reported for different years in the same publication as separate events in the weighted or
unweighted meta-analyses (see online supplementary Table S5). The results of the sensitivity
analyses are available on the Newcastle University website (http://research.ncl.ac.uk/nefg/QOF).

Effect sizes for all the weighted meta-analyses were based on standardised mean differences
(SMD) as recommended for studies in which data obtained by measuring the same parameters on
different scales are included in meta-analyses(

25

,

26

).

Both weighted and unweighted meta-analyses were carried out using the R statistical
programming environment(

30

). Weighted meta-analyses, with the SMD as the basic response variable, were
conducted using standard methods and the open-source ‘metafor’ statistical package(

31

–

34

). A detailed description of the methods and calculations used is given in the
‘Additional Methods Description’ section in the online supplementary material.

A positive SMD value indicates that the mean concentrations of the observed compound are
greater in the organic food samples, while a negative SMD indicates that the mean
concentrations are higher in the conventional food samples. The statistical significance of a
reported effect size (i.e. SMDtot) and CI were estimated based on standard
methods(

35

) using ‘metafor’(

31

). The influence of potential moderators, such as crop/food type (fruits,
vegetables, cereals, oil seeds and pulses, herbs and spices, and crop-based compound foods),
was additionally tested using mixed-effect models(

36

) and subgroup analyses.

We carried out tests of homogeneity (Q statistics and I
2 statistics) on all the summary effect sizes. Homogeneity was indicated if
I
2 was less than 25 % and the P value for the Q
statistics was greater than 0·010. Funnel plots, Egger tests of funnel plot asymmetry and
fail-safe number tests were used to assess publication bias(

37

) (see online supplementary Table S13 for further information).

For the unweighted meta-analysis, the ratio of organic means:conventional means () expressed as a percentage was ln-transformed, and the values were used to
determine whether the arithmetic average of the ln-transformed ratios was significantly greater
than ln(100), using resampling(

38

). The reported P values were derived from Fisher's one-sample
randomisation test(

39

), and a P< 0·05 was considered statistically significant.
For all composition parameters for which a statistically significant difference between organic
and conventional food samples was detected in the standard weighted analysis (analysis 1),
forest plots were constructed to show SMD and corresponding 95 % CI for individual studies and
types of foods (see Fig. 4 and online supplementary
Figs. S5–S41). In addition, the results of the standard unweighted analyses are shown in Figs. 3 and ​and44.

Table S12 (available online) summarises the results of the standard weighted and unweighted
meta-analyses for all the composition parameters for which no analyses detected significant
differences between organic and conventional products.

MPD were calculated for all parameters for which significant effects were detected by the
standard unweighted and/or weighted meta-analysis protocols. This was done to facilitate value
judgements regarding the biological importance of the relative effect magnitudes. A detailed
description of the calculations is given in the ‘Additional Methods Description’ section in the
online supplementary material.

We also calculated MPD using only data pairs included in the weighted meta-analyses to
estimate the impact of excluding data for which no measures of variance were reported on the
magnitude of difference. As the MPD can be expressed as ‘% higher’ in conventional or organic
crops, they provide estimates for the magnitude of composition differences that are easier to
correlate with existing information on the potential health impacts of changing dietary intake
levels for individual or groups of compounds than the SMD values. The 95 % CI for MPD were
estimated using a standard method(

35

).

For some composition parameters, individual effect sizes were more than fifty times greater
than the pooled effect. This applied to one effect size each for phenolic acids, flavanones,
flavones, flavonols, carbohydrates, DM and ; four effect sizes for carotenoids and xanthophylls; eight effect sizes for
amino acids; and forty-one effect sizes for volatile compounds. Such large differences can be
considered biologically implausible, and these ‘outlier’ data pairs were therefore omitted from
the final standard meta-analyses as shown in Figs. 3 and
​and44 and Tables S10 and S11 (available online).

Data reported for the frequency of occurrence of detectable pesticide residues (percentage of
samples with detectable pesticide residues) in organic and conventional crops were compared
using a weighted meta-analysis protocol based on the ln-transformed OR(

40

). The formula used to calculate OR is given in the ‘Additional Methods Description’
section in the online supplementary material.

An overall assessment of the strength of evidence was made using an adaptation of the GRADE
(Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system(

41

).

Analyses were based on data from publications reporting results from EX (154 papers), CF (116
papers), and BS (fifty-five papers) or results from more than one type of study (EX, CF and/or
BS; eighteen papers) (see online supplementary Table S3).

Approximately 70 % of all the studies included in the meta-analyses were carried out in
Europe, mainly in Italy, Spain, Poland, Sweden, the Czech Republic, Switzerland, Turkey,
Denmark, Finland and Germany, with most of the remaining studies being carried out in the USA,
Brazil, Canada and Japan (see online supplementary Table S3 and Fig. S2). Among the papers
included in the meta-analyses, 174 reported comparison data for vegetables and a smaller number
reported data for fruits and cereals (112 and sixty-one, respectively), while only thirty-seven
reported data for other crops/crop-based food products (e.g. oil seeds and pulses, herbs and
spices, and compound foods) (see online supplementary Table S3). Publications reported data for
907 different composition parameters, of which 182 were included in the meta-analyses (see
online supplementary Tables S6 and S7).

A large number of comparisons were available for antioxidant activity in organic and
conventional crops (160 for the unweighted meta-analysis and sixty-six for the weighted
meta-analysis), but the authors used a wide range of different methodologies. Both weighted and
unweighted meta-analyses detected a significantly higher antioxidant activity in organic crops
(Fig. 3) and the MPD was 17 (95 % CI 3, 32) % (Fig. 3).

When data reported for fruits and vegetables were analysed separately, a significant
difference was detected for fruits, while only a trend towards a significant difference
(P= 0·06) was observed for vegetables (Fig.
4), although there was no evidence of an interaction.

When data available for specific antioxidant activity assays were analysed, similar results
were obtained for the Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity assay with both the standard
weighted and unweighted meta-analyses and for the ferric reducing antioxidant power and oxygen
radical absorbance capacity assays with only the standard unweighted meta-analysis (Fig. 3).

The concentrations of secondary metabolites with antioxidant activity, including a wide range
of nutritionally desirable (poly)phenolics, were also studied in a relatively large number of
studies (see online supplementary Table S8).

For (poly)phenolics, the standard weighted meta-analysis detected significantly and
substantially higher concentrations of total flavonoids, total phenolic acids, phenolic acids
(where data reported for all individual phenolic acid compounds were included in the same
analysis), flavanones, stilbenes, flavones, flavonols, kaempferol, total anthocyanins and
anthocyanins in organic crops and/or processed foods made from organic crops. The unweighted
meta-analysis yielded similar results, except for (1) total flavonoids, for which no
significant difference was detected, and (2) flavanones and flavones, for which only trends
towards higher concentrations in organic crops were detected (Fig. 3). The unweighted meta-analysis also detected significantly higher
concentrations of chlorogenic acid (5-O-caffeoylquinic acid) in organic crops
(Fig. 3). The MPD for most of the compounds were
between 18 and 69 % for most of the above-mentioned antioxidant compounds (Fig. 3). Inclusion of data for which no measures of variance were reported
in the calculation of MPD yielded similar values for phenolic compounds, phenolic acids,
chlorogenic acid, flavones, quercetin, kaempferol and anthocyanins; higher values for phenolic
acids (total), stilbenes and quercetin-3-rutinoside; and lower values for flavonoids,
flavanones and flavonols (see Fig. 4 and online
supplementary Table S9).

When data reported for phenolic compounds, phenolic acids and flavanones in fruits,
vegetables, cereals and/or processed crop-based foods were analysed separately, significant
differences were detected only for the concentrations of phenolic compounds and phenolic acids
in fruits and a trend towards a significant difference (P= 0·09) was detected
for the concentrations of flavanones in fruits (Fig. 4),
although there was no evidence of an interaction. In contrast, when differences in the
concentrations of flavones and flavonols were analysed separately for fruits, vegetables and
cereals, significant differences were detected for vegetables and cereals, but not for fruits,
with evidence of interactions (Fig. 4). For all other
antioxidant/(poly)phenolic compounds, separate analyses for different crop types were not
possible due to the unavailability of sufficient data.

Smaller, but statistically significant and biologically meaningful composition differences
were also detected for a small number of carotenoids and vitamins. Both unweighted and weighted
meta-analyses detected significantly higher concentrations of xanthophylls and
l-ascorbic acid and significantly lower concentrations of vitamin E in organic crops.
Higher concentrations of total carotenoids, carotenoids (where data reported for all individual
phenolic acid compounds were included in the same analysis) and lutein were also detected by
the unweighted meta-analysis (Fig. 3). The MPD were 17
(95 % CI 0, 34) % for total carotenoids, 15 (95 % CI − 3, 32) % for carotenoids (where data
reported for all individual carotenoid compounds were included in the same analysis), 12 (95 %
CI − 4, 28) % for xanthophylls, 5 (95 % CI − 3, 13) % for lutein, 6 (95 % CI − 3, 15) % for
vitamin C and − 15 (95 % CI − 49, 19) % for vitamin E. Inclusion of data for which no measures
of variance were reported in the calculation of MPD resulted in slightly higher values (see
Fig. 4 and online supplementary Table S9).

When data reported for total carotenoids and xanthophylls in fruits, vegetables, cereals and
processed crop-based compound foods were analysed separately, significantly higher
concentrations in organic samples were detected only for fruits (Fig. 4), with evidence of interactions being detected for carotenoids, but
not for xanthophylls.

The meta-analyses did not detect significant differences for a range of other secondary
metabolites with antioxidant activity. These included some individual carotenoids (α-carotene,
lycopene, β-cryptoxanthin and zeaxanthin), vitamins (α-tocopherol, γ-tocopherol, vitamin B and
vitamin B1), some specific phenolic acids (total hydroxycinnamic acids, caffeic
acid, p-coumaric acid, ferulic acid, sinapic acid,
5-O-caffeoylquinic acid, ellagic acid, gallic acid and salicylic acid), some
specific flavones and flavonols (apigenin, luteolin, myricetin 3-O-glucoside,
quercetin 3-O-galactoside, quercetin-3-O-glucoside and
quercetin-3-O-malonyl glucoside) and some specific flavanones (naringenin and
naringenin (R-enantiomer)).

Both unweighted and weighted meta-analyses detected significantly higher concentrations of
total carbohydrates and significantly lower concentrations of proteins, amino acids and fibre
in organic crops/crop-based compound foods (Fig. 3). The
unweighted meta-analysis also detected significantly higher concentrations of reducing sugars
and DM in organic crops (Fig. 4). The MPD were 25 (95 %
CI 5, 45) % for total carbohydrates, 11 (95 % CI 2, 20) % for carbohydrates (where data
reported for all individual phenolic acid compounds were included in the same analysis), 7
(95 % CI 4, 11) % for reducing sugars, − 15 (95 % CI − 27, − 3) % for proteins, − 11 (95 % CI
− 14, − 8) % for amino acids, 2 (95 % CI − 1, 6) % for DM and − 8 (95 % CI − 14, − 2) % for
fibre. Inclusion of data for which no measures of variance were reported in the calculation of
MPD resulted in similar values for carbohydrates, proteins, DM and fibre; higher values for
reducing sugars; and lower values for carbohydrates (total) and amino acids (see Fig. 4 and online supplementary Table S9).

When data reported for proteins and amino acids in vegetables, cereals and/or processed
crop-based foods were analysed separately, significant differences were detected for cereals
and processed crop-based foods, but not for vegetables (Fig.
4), although there was no evidence of an interaction. Also, when data reported for
carbohydrates in vegetables, fruits and cereals were analysed separately, no significant
effects could be detected in their concentrations (Fig.
4).

Both weighted and unweighted meta-analyses detected significantly lower concentrations of the
toxic metal Cd and total N in organic crops, while lower concentrations of  and  in organic crops were detected only by the unweighted meta-analysis (Fig. 3). The MPD were − 48 (95 % CI − 112, 16) % for Cd, − 10
(95 % CI − 15, − 4) % for N, − 30 (95 % CI − 144, 84) % for  and − 87 (95 % CI − 225, 52) % for  (Fig. 3).

Inclusion of data for which no measures of variance were reported in the calculation of MPD
resulted in similar values for N, ,  and Cd (see Fig. 4 and online
supplementary Table S9).

When data reported for N and Cd concentrations in fruits, vegetables and cereals were
analysed separately, significant differences were detected for cereals, but not for vegetables
and/or fruits (Fig. 4), although there was no evidence
of an interaction.

For the toxic metals As and Pb, no significant differences could be detected in their
concentrations between organic and conventional crops in the meta-analyses (see online
supplementary Table S12).

The standard meta-analyses showed that the frequency of occurrence of detectable pesticide
residues was four times higher in conventional crops (46 (95 % CI 38, 55) %) than in organic
crops (11 (95 % CI 7, 14) %) (Fig. 5). Significantly
higher frequencies of occurrence of pesticide residues in conventional crops were also detected
when data reported for fruits, vegetables and processed crop-based foods were analysed
separately (Fig. 5). Conventional fruits had a higher
frequency (75 (95 % CI 65, 85) %) of occurrence of pesticide residues than vegetables (32 (95 %
CI 22, 43) %) and crop-based compound foods (45 (95 % CI 25, 65) %), while contamination rates
were very similar in the different organic crop types. This resulted in significant differences
in the OR for different crop types (Fig. 5).

For most of the minerals (including many plant marco- and micronutrients), the meta-analyses
could not detect significant composition differences between organic and conventional crops
(see online supplementary Table S12). However, for a small number of minerals, differences in
composition were identified by both weighted and unweighted meta-analyses, which detected
significantly lower concentrations of Cr and Sr ( − 59 (95 % CI − 147, 30) % and − 26 (95 % CI
− 45, − 6) %, respectively), but significantly higher concentrations of Mo and Rb (65 (95 % CI
26, 105) % and 82 (95 % CI 6, 157) %, respectively) in organic crops. Also, lower
concentrations of Mn ( − 8 (95 % CI − 13, − 3) %) and higher concentrations of Ga and Mg in
organic crops (57 (95 % CI − 122, 8) % and 4 (95 % CI − 5, 13) %, respectively) were detected
only by the weighted meta-analysis, while slightly higher concentrations of Zn (5 (95 % CI − 6,
15) %) in organic crops were only detected by the unweighted meta-analysis (see online
supplementary Table S11). As differences for Zn and Mg were relatively small and as there is
limited information about potential health impacts associated with changing intake levels of
either mineral (Cr, Ga, Mo, Sr and Mo), more detailed results are provided only in the online
supplementary material.

Heterogeneity was extremely high (I
2>75 %) for most of the composition parameters, with I
2 ranging from 76 % for ascorbic acid to 100 % for carotenoids and DM (Fig. 3). The only exceptions were vitamin E, reducing sugars,
fibre and , for which the small number of studies and/or high within-study variability
limited the ability to distinguish heterogeneity between the effects.

Strong or moderate funnel plot asymmetry consistent with a publication bias was detected for
approximately half of the parameters. However, it is not possible to definitively attribute
discrepancies between large precise studies and small imprecise studies to publication bias,
which remains strongly suspected rather than detected where asymmetry is severe (see Table 1 and online supplementary Table S13).


GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessments, Development and Evaluation) assessment of
the strength of evidence for standard weighted meta-analysis for parameters included in
Fig. 3 (Standardised mean difference values (SMD)
and 95 % confidence intervals)

FRAP, ferric reducing antioxidant potential; ORAC, oxygen radical absorbance capacity;
TEAC, Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity.

When meta-analysis results obtained from different study types (BS, CF and EX) were compared,
similar results were obtained for most of the composition parameters included in Fig. 3 (see online supplementary Figs. S3 and S4). However,
there was considerable variation between results obtained for different crop types, crop
species, and/or studies carried out in countries with contrasting pedo-climatic and agronomic
background conditions (see Fig. 4 and online
supplementary Figs. S5–S41).

Non-weighted MPD were calculated to aid in the biological interpretation of effect size
magnitude where either the weighted or unweighted meta-analysis had identified statistically
significant results. For many parameters, MPD based on all the available data produced values
very similar to those calculated using only data for which measures of variance were reported
( = those used for the weighted meta-analysis; Fig. 3).
However, for other parameters (flavonoids, total phenolic acids, flavanones, rutin,
l-ascorbic acid, reducing sugars and Cd), inclusion criteria had a large effect on the
MPD.

Also, when the calculated MPD were superimposed onto SMD (with 95 % CI) results at an
appropriate scale ( − 100 to +100 for MPD and − 5 to +5 for SMD), a reasonable match was
observed, with MPD for most of the compounds being present within the 95 % CI for SMD (Fig. 3). However, for some parameters (Trolox equivalent
antioxidant capacity, total phenolic acids, stilbenes, rutin, total carotenoids,
l-ascorbic acid, vitamin E, reducing sugars, proteins, ,  and Cd), MPD were outside the 95 % CI of SMD, and therefore these should be
seen as less reliable.

For the composition parameters included in Fig. 3,
sensitivity analyses, which were based on different inclusion criteria and data-handling
methods, yielded results broadly similar to those yielded by the standard weighted and
unweighted meta-analyses.

The overall assessment of the strength of evidence using an adapted GRADE(

41

) approach highlighted uncertainties in the evidence base, but the overall strength
of evidence was moderate or high for the majority of parameters for which significant
differences were detected (see Table 1 and online
supplementary Table S13).

The results of meta-analyses of the extensive data set of 343 peer-reviewed publications
indicated that organic crops and processed crop-based foods have a higher antioxidant activity
and contain higher concentrations of a wide range of nutritionally desirable
antioxidants/(poly)phenolics, but lower concentrations of the potentially harmful, toxic metal
Cd. For plant secondary metabolites, this confirms the results of the meta-analyses carried out
by Brandt et al.
(

20

), which indicated that there are significant composition differences between organic
and conventional crops for a range of nutritionally relevant compounds. However, it contradicts
the results of the systematic reviews/meta-analyses by Dangour et al.
(

19

) and Smith-Spangler et al.
(

21

), which indicated that there are no significant composition differences between
organic and conventional crops. The main reason for the inability of previous studies to detect
composition differences was probably the highly limited number of studies/data sets available or
included in analyses by these authors, which would have decreased the statistical power of the
meta-analyses.

In addition, most of the previous studies did not use weighted meta-analyses based on SMD.
This approach is recommended when combining data from studies that measure the same parameter
(e.g. the major phenolic compounds found in different crops), but use different scales(

25

,

26

,

29

). In the study carried out by Dangour et al.
(

19

), published data from (1) surveys in which the organic samples were produced to
‘biodynamic-organic’ standards and (2) field experiments investigating associations between
organic and conventional production protocols and crop composition were not included in the
meta-analyses. This would have further reduced the number of data sets and sensitivity of
meta-analyses and contributed to the lack of significant composition differences being detected.
In the meta-analyses carried out in the present study, ‘biodynamic-organic’ data sets were
treated as organic, as biodynamic standards comply with the legal European Union organic farming
standards. Data from comparative field experiments were also included, as controlled
experimental studies are less affected by confounding factors (e.g. contrasting soil and
climatic and agronomic background conditions between farms that supplied organic and
conventional samples) than farm and retail surveys. The reason for excluding field experiments
carried out in the study of Dangour et al.
(

19

) is that in the field experiments the organic plots were not certified according to
organic farming standards. In the meta-analyses carried out in the present study, field
experiments investigating associations between organic and conventional agronomic
practices/protocols and crop composition were included, as the crop management practices rather
than the certification process were assumed to affect crop performance and composition.

The finding of a four times higher frequency of occurrence of pesticide residues in
conventional crops confirms the results of the study of Smith-Spangler et al.
(

21

), in which a very similar set of studies (nine of the ten publications used in the
present study) were used for analysis.

The potential (1) nutritional benefits of higher concentrations of antioxidant/(poly)phenolics
in organic crops, (2) risks associated with potentially harmful pesticide residues, Cd,  and , and (3) agronomic factors responsible for composition differences are
discussed in more detail below.
Antioxidants/(poly)phenolics

Among the composition differences detected by the meta-analyses carried out in the present
study, the higher antioxidant activity and higher concentrations of a wide range of
antioxidants/(poly)phenolics found in organic crops/crop-based foods may indicate the greatest
potential nutritional benefits. Based on the differences reported, results indicate that a
switch from conventional to organic crop consumption would result in a 20–40 % (and for some
compounds more than 60 %) increase in crop-based antioxidant/(poly)phenolic intake levels
without a simultaneous increase in energy, which would be in line with the dietary
recommendations(

16

,

17

). This estimated magnitude of difference would be equivalent to the amount of
antioxidants/(poly)phenolics present in one to two of the five portions of fruits and
vegetables recommended to be consumed daily and would therefore be significant/meaningful in
terms of human nutrition, if information linking these plant secondary metabolites to the
health benefits associated with increased fruit, vegetable and whole grain consumption is
confirmed(

16

–

18

).

However, it is important to point out that there is still a lack of knowledge about the
potential human health impacts of increasing antioxidant/(poly)phenolic intake levels and
switching to organic food consumption. For example, there are still gaps in the understanding
of the (1) uptake, bioavailability and metabolism of (poly)phenolics after ingestion and (2)
exact compounds/molecules and modes of action responsible for health benefits(

16

). Also, it is important to consider that most of the human dietary intervention
studies on associations between antioxidant/(poly)phenolic intake and health indicators were
based on the comparison of standard diets with diets in which the amount of specific
(poly)phenolic-rich foods (e.g. cocoa, red wine, tea/coffee, berries, citrus and nuts) was
high(

16

,

17

).

There are, to our knowledge, only two human dietary intervention studies in which contrasting
antioxidant/(poly)phenolic intake levels were generated by providing diets based on
conventional and organic crops; both studies focused on assessing antioxidant status in humans
and were inconclusive with respect to the identification of potential health impacts of organic
food consumption(

21

,

42

,

43

). However, there are several animal dietary intervention studies that have
identified significant associations between organic feed consumption and animal growth and
physiological (including immune and endocrine) parameters and/or biomarkers of health when
compared with conventional feed consumption(

44

,

45

). Among these studies, one recent factorial animal study has gone one step further
and assessed associations between contrasting crop fertilisation and crop protection protocols
used in conventional and organic farming systems and (1) the composition (including
(poly)phenolic content) of crops/compound feeds made from crops and (2) the growth,
physiological, immunological and hormonal parameters of rats that consumed these feeds(

46

). With respect to composition differences, the study yielded results similar to
those of the meta-analyses carried out in the present study. For example, rat feeds produced
from organic crops had lower concentrations of proteins and Cd, but higher concentrations of
polyphenols and the carotenoid lutein. The study also demonstrated that composition differences
were mainly linked to contrasting fertilisation regimens (green and animal manures
v. mineral fertiliser inputs). The consumption of feeds made from organic
crops by the rats resulted in higher levels of body protein, body ash, leucocyte count, plasma
glucose, leptin, insulin-like growth factor 1, corticosterone, and IgM, and spontaneous
lymphocyte proliferation, but lower levels of plasma IgG, testosterone and mitogen-stimulated
proliferation of lymphocytes(

46

). Redundancy analysis identified total polyphenol concentrations in feeds as the
strongest driver for the physiological/endocrinological parameters assessed in rats. This
suggests that a switch from conventional to organic crop consumption may have impacts similar
to those of an increase in the intake of foods with high antioxidant/(poly)phenolic contents.
This hypothesis would merit further exploration in animal and human dietary intervention
studies.

Many of the antioxidants, including (poly)phenolics, found in higher concentrations in
organic crops are known to be produced by plants in response to abiotic (e.g. wounding and
heat, water and nutrient stress) and biotic (pest attacks and disease) stress and form part of
the plants' constitutive and inducible resistance mechanisms to pests and diseases(

47

–

49

). Therefore, higher concentrations of (poly)phenolics in organic crops may be due
to higher incidence/severity of pest and disease damage, causing enhanced (poly)phenolic
production as part of the inducible plant resistance response. The differences in antioxidant
concentrations between organic and conventional crops may therefore have been due to
contrasting pest and disease damage and/or fertilisation intensity. However, there are, to our
knowledge, no sound published data/evidence for a causal link between higher pest/disease
incidence/severity and antioxidant/(poly)phenolic concentrations in organic crops. In contrast,
there is increasing evidence that differences in fertilisation regimens between organic and
conventional production systems (and, in particular, the non-use of high mineral N fertiliser
inputs) are significant drivers for higher (poly)phenolic concentrations in organic crops(

20

,

49

–

52

). For example, Sander & Heitefuss(

50

) reported that increasing mineral N fertilisation resulted in reduced
concentrations of phenolic resistance compounds in wheat leaves and increased severity of
foliar disease (powdery mildew). Similarly, a review by Rühmann et al.
(

51

) describes the negative correlations between N fertilisation/supply-driven shoot
growth and concentrations of phenylpropanoids and apple scab resistance in young leaves in
apple trees(

51

). In tomato, deficiency of both N and P was found to be linked to flavonol
accumulation in plant tissues(

52

). More recently, Almuayrifi(

49

) has demonstrated that the non-use of synthetic pesticides and fungicides has no
effect on phenolic acid and flavonoid concentrations and profiles in wheat, but that the use of
standard, conventional mineral (NPK) fertiliser regimens is associated with significantly lower
phenolic acid and flavonoid concentrations in wheat leaves compared with organic wheat crops
fertilised with green and animal manures only. The variability in relative differences in
antioxidant/(poly)phenolic concentrations found between studies and crops may therefore at
least partially be explained by variability in the fertilisation protocols in both the organic
and non-organic systems compared. The finding in the present study that organic crops have
significantly lower N,  and  concentrations would support the theory that differences in
antioxidant/(poly)phenolic concentrations between organic and conventional crops are driven by
contrasting N supply patterns. This view is supported by previous studies that have suggested
that under high N availability, plants allocate carbohydrates from photosynthesis to primary
metabolism and rapid growth while producing less amounts of secondary metabolites involved in
defence(

51

).

However, additional research is required to gain a more detailed understanding of the
relative contribution of fertilisation and crop protection regimens and disease and pest
prevalence/severity to the expression of constitutive and inducible resistance mechanisms in
different organically managed crop plants(

50

).
Cadmium and pesticide residues

Cd is a highly toxic metal and one of the only three toxic metal contaminants (the other two
being Pb and Hg) for which the European Commission has set maximum residue levels (MRL) in
foods(

53

). Cd accumulates in the human body (especially in the liver and kidneys) and
therefore dietary Cd intake levels should be kept as low as possible(

53

). The on average 48 % lower Cd concentrations found in organic crops/crop-based
foods in the meta-analyses carried out in the present study are therefore desirable, although
the exact health benefits associated with reducing Cd intake levels via a switch to organic
food consumption are difficult to estimate. Similar to the results of the present study, a
recent literature review by Smith-Spangler et al.
(

21

) has also reported that of the seventy-seven comparative data sets (extracted from
fifteen publications), twenty-one indicated significantly lower and only one significantly
higher Cd concentrations in organic foods. Differences in Cd contamination levels between
organic and conventional winter wheat have recently been shown to be mainly linked to
differences in fertilisation regimens (especially the high mineral P inputs used in
conventional farming systems), although contrasting rotation designs also contributed to
differences in Cd concentrations between organic and conventional wheat(

7

). A range of other soil (e.g. pH) and agronomic (e.g. liming) factors are known to
affect Cd concentrations in crops(

54

), and these may explain the variability in results between individual comparative
studies, crop species and crop types (see Fig. 4 and
online supplementary Figs. S4 and S22).

The present study demonstrated that the prohibition of synthetic chemical pesticide use under
organic farming standards results in a more than 4-fold reduction in the number of crop samples
with detectable pesticide residues. This supports previous studies that have concluded that
organic food consumption can reduce exposure to pesticide residues(

21

–

23

). The considerably higher frequency of occurrence of detectable residues in
conventional fruits (75 %) than in vegetables (32 %) may indicate higher levels of crop
protection inputs being used in fruit crops, but could also have been due to the use of more
persistent chemicals, different sprayer technologies used and/or pesticide applications being
made closer to harvest. The finding of detectable pesticide residues in a proportion (about
11 %) of organic crop samples may have been due to cross-contamination from neighbouring
conventional fields, the continued presence of very persistent pesticides (e.g. organochlorine
compounds) in fields or perennial crop tissues from past conventional management, and/or
accidental or fraudulent use of prohibited pesticides in organic farms.

Pesticide residues that are below the MRL set by the European Commission(

55

,

56

) are considered by regulators not to pose risk to consumers or the environment, as
they are significantly lower than concentrations for which negative health or environmental
impacts can be detected in the regulatory pesticide safety testing carried out as part of the
pesticide approval process(

55

). However, a significant number of crop samples included in the regulatory European
Food Safety Authority pesticide residue monitoring in Europe are still found to contain
pesticide residues above the MRL(

57

). For example, in recent European Food Safety Authority surveys, pesticide residues
above the MRL have been found in 6·2 % of spinach, 3·8 % of oat, 3·4 % of peach, 3·0 % of
orange, 2·9 % of strawberry and lettuce, 2·8 % of table grape and 2·7 % of apple samples
analysed(

57

). There is still scientific controversy about the safety of some currently
permitted pesticides (e.g. organophosphorus compounds) even at levels below the MRL and complex
mixtures of pesticides, as additive/synergistic effects of pesticide mixtures have been
documented and safety testing of pesticide mixtures is currently not required as part of the
regulatory pesticide approval process(

58

–

60

). Similar to Cd, the lower risk of exposure to pesticide residues can be considered
desirable, but potential health benefits associated with reducing pesticide exposure via a
switch to organic food consumption are impossible to estimate.

It should be pointed out that (1) there are only eleven studies in which the frequencies of
occurrence of pesticide residues were compared, (2) eight of these studies focused on only one
crop species, (3) no comparative studies for cereals, oilseeds and pulses were identified in
the literature review, and (4) the data available did not allow scientifically robust
comparisons of the concentrations of pesticides. Therefore, it is important to carry out
further studies to improve our understanding of differences in the frequency of occurrence and
concentrations of pesticide residues between organic and conventional crops.
Proteins, amino acids, nitrogen and nitrate/nitrite

The concentrations of proteins, amino acids and N (which are known to be positively
correlated in plants) were found to be lower in organic crops, and this is consistent with the
results of previous studies that have linked lower protein concentrations to lower N inputs and
N availability in organic crop production systems(

61

,

62

). The nutritional significance/relevance of slightly lower protein and amino acid
concentrations in organic crops to human health is likely to be low, as European and North
American diets typically provide sufficient or even excessive amounts of proteins and essential
amino acids. Also, while some studies concluded that protein content in most European and North
American diets is too high and that this contributes to the increasing incidence of diabetes
and obesity(

63

), other studies reported that increasing protein intake levels may be a strategy to
prevent obesity(

64

). Therefore, the lower protein and amino acid concentrations found in organic foods
are unlikely to have a significant nutritional or health impact.

The higher  and  concentrations in conventional crops are also thought to be linked to high
mineral N inputs, as both  and  are known to accumulate in plants under high-mineral N input regimens(

65

). The higher  concentrations in conventional crops/crop-based foods are nutritionally
undesirable, as they have been described to be risk factors for stomach cancer and
methaemoglobinaemia in humans(

65

). However, while increasing dietary  intake levels is widely considered to be potentially harmful for human
health, there is still controversy about the potential health impacts of crop-based dietary  intake(

65

–

67

).
Effects of crop type/species/variety, study type and other sources of variation

One of the main challenges to interpreting comparisons of organic and inorganic food
production systems is the high heterogeneity arising from combinations of (1) crops, crop types
and/or crop-based foods, (2) countries, and/or (3) pedo-climatic and agronomic background
conditions. As has been mentioned in previous reviews(

19

–

21

), pooling diverse information was necessary, because for most of the composition
parameters, the number of published studies available was not sufficient to carry out separate
meta-analyses for specific countries/regions and crop types and species. Consequently,
heterogeneity was extremely high (I
2>75 %) for most of the composition parameters for which significant
differences were detected.

For many composition parameters, the method of synthesis did not have large effects on
results, in terms of both statistical significance and the magnitude of relative difference
between organic and conventional crops. This indicates that there is now a sufficiently large
body of published information to identify differences that are relatively consistent across
study types, crops, and pedo-climatic and agronomic environments. Therefore, for these
parameters, future studies should focus on increasing our understanding of the underlying
agronomic, pedo-climatic and crop genetic factors responsible for composition differences
between organic and conventional crops.

For other composition parameters (e.g. ferric reducing antioxidant power, oxygen radical
absorbance capacity, Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity, and levels of flavonoids,
stilbenes, total carotenoids, l-ascorbic acid, proteins,  and Cd), differences in methods had a large impact in terms of both
significant effects being detected and/or estimates of the magnitude of difference based on MPD
and SMD. For these compounds, additional high-quality studies (that report measures of
variance) are required to increase the power of weighted meta-analyses.

Overall assessment of the strength of evidence for antioxidant/(poly)phenolic parameters
indicated high or moderate reliability for thirteen of the nineteen parameters and moderate
reliability for Cd. This supports the conclusion that future research would likely be
confirmatory.

In contrast to previous literature reviews(

19

–

21

), the larger number of studies now available allowed separate meta-analyses to be
carried out for different crop types (e.g. fruits, vegetables and cereals), but only for a
limited number of composition parameters. This demonstrates that there is variation between
crop types with respect to (1) whether the production system has a significant effect and/or
(2) the magnitude of difference between organic and conventional crops, although sample sizes
remain insufficient to detect interactions between crop types in many cases.

The present study also identified variation between studies (1) carried out in countries with
different pedo-climatic conditions and agronomic protocols (e.g. rotation designs, irrigated or
non-irrigated crop production, and level and type of animal manures used) and/or (2) focused on
different crop species. This is not surprising as both genetic and environmental/agronomic
factors are known to affect the concentrations of N, , , proteins, sugars, antioxidants/(poly)phenolics, Cd and pesticides in
crops(

7

,

9

–

12

,

20

,

47

–

52

,

62

). However, due to the lack of detailed information on agronomic and pedo-climatic
background conditions in most of the available literature, it is currently not possible to
quantify the relative contribution of genetic and environmental/agronomic sources of variation.

The unweighted MPD were calculated to provide an estimate of the magnitude of difference that
is meaningful when considering nutritional/health impacts of changes in crop composition.
However, care should be taken when interpreting MPD values, as they do not take variability in
the precision of individual studies into account(

25

) and provide less precise estimates of effect than weighted estimates.

However, there is now evidence from a large number of quality studies that consistently show
that organic production systems result in crops/crop-based compound foods with higher
concentrations of antioxidants/(poly)phenolics and lower concentrations of Cd and pesticide
residues compared with conventional production systems. There is little uncertainty surrounding
this overall result, but further research is required to quantify more accurately the relative
impacts of (1) crop types, species, and varieties/cultivars/hybrids and (2) agronomic and
pedo-climatic background conditions on the relative difference between organic and conventional
crop composition.
The need for use of standardised protocols for comparative food composition studies

The present study identified deficiencies in a large proportion of the published studies.
These included a lack of standardised measurements and a lack of reporting (and, in particular,
the non-reporting of measures of variability and/or replication) for many composition
parameters, and there was evidence of duplicate or selective reporting of data collected in
experiments, which may lead to publication bias. Particularly, there is a lack of studies
comparing pesticide residue levels in organic and conventional crops, and there has been very
little effort taken to re-analyse and then publish available comparative data from food
surveillance surveys (e.g. the regular pesticide residue and food composition surveys carried
out by the European Food Safety Authority and national agencies in Europe and elsewhere). Also,
in many studies, there was a lack of detailed information on (1) the geographical origin of
samples in retail surveys and (2) agronomic (e.g. rotation, fertilisation, tillage and
irrigation regimens), pedo-climatic and crop genetic backgrounds (in farm surveys and field
experiments), which would allow potential sources of variation to be investigated.

Not all studies included in the meta-analyses used certified reference materials as a quality
assurance measure for the accuracy of estimates of concentrations of compounds in crops. This
is unlikely to have affected the estimates of relative differences between organic and
conventional crops, as the same extraction and analytical methods were used for organic and
conventional samples in all the studies included in the meta-analyses in the present study.
However, data from studies that did not use reference materials are less reliable when used to
estimate the concentrations of nutritionally relevant compounds in crops and total dietary
intake levels of such compounds in crop-based foods.

Therefore, it is important to develop guidelines for studies comparing the impacts of
agronomic practices on crop/food composition to minimise heterogeneity and/or allow agronomic,
environmental and crop genetic drivers to be used as covariates in analyses.
The need for dietary intervention/cohort studies to identify health impacts

A recent review by Smith-Spangler et al.
(

21

) has analysed the results of fourteen studies in which the effects of organic and
conventional food (both crop and livestock product) consumption on clinical outcomes (e.g.
allergic symptoms and Campylobacter infections) and health markers (e.g. serum
lipid and vitamin concentrations) were studied. However, they concluded that the currently
available data do not allow clear trends with respect to health markers and outcomes to be
identified. Therefore, there is an urgent need for well-controlled human intervention and/or
cohort studies to identify/quantify potential human health impacts of organic
v. conventional food consumption.

Diet composition may have an effect on the relative impact of switching from conventional to
organic food consumption, and this should be considered in the design of such studies. For
example, the relative impact of switching from conventional to organic food consumption could
be expected to be smaller for diets with high amounts of (poly)phenolic-rich foods.

Demand for organic foods is partially driven by consumers' perceptions that they are more
nutritious. However, scientific opinion is divided on whether there are significant nutritional
differences between organic and non-organic foods, and two recent reviews have concluded that
there are no differences. In the present study, we carried out meta-analyses based on 343
peer-reviewed publications that indicate statistically significant and meaningful differences
in composition between organic and non-organic crops/crop-based foods. Most importantly, the
concentrations of a range of antioxidants such as polyphenolics were found to be substantially
higher in organic crops/crop-based foods, with those of phenolic acids, flavanones, stilbenes,
flavones, flavonols and anthocyanins being an estimated 19 (95 % CI 5, 33) %, 69 (95 % CI 13,
125) %, 28 (95 % CI 12, 44) %, 26 (95 % CI 3, 48) %, 50 (95 % CI 28, 72) % and 51 (95 % CI 17,
86) % higher, respectively. Many of these compounds have previously been linked to a reduced
risk of chronic diseases, including CVD and neurodegenerative diseases and certain cancers, in
dietary intervention and epidemiological studies. Additionally, the frequency of occurrence of
pesticide residues was found to be four times higher in conventional crops, which also
contained significantly higher concentrations of the toxic metal Cd. Significant differences
were also detected for some other (e.g. minerals and vitamins) compounds. There is evidence
that higher antioxidant concentrations and lower Cd concentrations are linked to specific
agronomic practices (e.g. non-use of mineral N and P fertilisers, respectively) prescribed in
organic farming systems. In conclusion, organic crops, on average, have higher concentrations
of antioxidants, lower concentrations of Cd and a lower incidence of pesticide residues than
the non-organic comparators across regions and production seasons.

Increased public concerns about the negative environmental and health impacts of agrochemicals
(pesticides, growth regulators and mineral fertilisers) used in crop production have been major
drivers for the increase in consumer demand for organic foods over the last 20 years(

1

–

3

).

Organic crop production standards prohibit the use of synthetic chemical crop protection
products and certain mineral fertilisers (all N, KCl and superphosphate) to reduce environmental
impacts (nitrate () leaching and P run-off and pesticide contamination of groundwater) and the
risk of pesticide residues being present in crop plants(

4

). Instead, they prescribe regular inputs of organic fertilisers (e.g. manure and
composts), use of legume crops in rotation (to increase soil N levels), and application of
preventative and non-chemical crop protection methods (e.g. the use of crop rotation, more
resistant/tolerant varieties, mechanical and flame weeding, and biological disease and pest
control products). However, organic standards permit the use of certain plant or microbial
extract and/or mineral (e.g. Cu- and S-based) crop protection products(

5

,

6

).

As a result, organic and conventional crop production may differ significantly in crop rotation
designs and fertilisation and crop protection protocols as well as in the type of crop varieties
used(

6

–

10

). Apart from minimising the risk of agrochemical residues being present in crops, the
agronomic protocols used in organic farming systems may also affect mineral uptake patterns and
metabolic processes in crop plants. Recent studies have shown that the switch from mineral to
organic fertilisers results in significant differences in gene and protein expression patterns
and, as a result, in secondary metabolite profiles; for example, approximately 10 % of proteins
have been found to be either up- or down-regulated in response to contrasting fertiliser inputs
in potato and wheat(

10

–

15

). Also, a switch from pesticide-based conventional to organic crop protection
protocols has been shown to have a significant, but more limited effect than fertilisation
regimens, and there were some statistically significant interactions between fertilisation and
crop protection protocols with respect to gene and protein expression pattern(

10

–

15

).

Over the last 20 years, a large number of scientific studies have compared the concentrations
of nutritionally relevant minerals (e.g. Fe, Zn, Cu and Se), toxic metals (e.g. Cd and Pb),
pesticide residues, macronutrients (e.g. proteins, fats and carbohydrates) and secondary
metabolites (e.g. antioxidants, (poly)phenolics and vitamins) in crops from organic and
conventional production systems (see the online supplementary material for a list of
publications).

There is particular interest in antioxidant activity/concentrations, as there is strong
scientific evidence for health benefits associated with increased consumption of crops rich in
(poly)phenolics and other plant secondary metabolites with antioxidant activity (e.g. carotenoids
and vitamins C and E)(

16

–

18

). Most importantly, a substantial number of human dietary intervention studies have
reported an increased dietary intake of antioxidant/(poly)phenolic-rich foods to protect against
chronic diseases, including CVD, certain cancers (e.g. prostate cancer) and neurodegenerative
diseases; a detailed description of the evidence has been given in recent reviews by Del Rio
et al.
(

16

) and Wahlqvist(

17

). Also, these plant secondary metabolites are increasingly being recognised to
contribute significantly to the health benefits associated with increased fruit, vegetable and
whole grain consumption(

16

–

18

).

Several systematic literature reviews have recently analysed the available published
information, using both qualitative and quantitative methods, with the aim of identifying the
potential effects of organic and conventional production protocols on the nutritional quality of
crops(

19

–

21

). However, these systematic reviews (1) used different methodologies (e.g. weighted
and unweighted meta-analyses) and inclusion criteria, (2) did not cover most of the large amount
of information published in the last 4–5 years, (3) provided no structured assessment of the
strength of the evidence presented, and (4) came to contrasting conclusions. As a result, there
is still considerable controversy as to whether the use of organic production standards results
in significant and consistent changes in the concentrations of potentially health-promoting (e.g.
antioxidants, (poly)phenolics, vitamins and certain minerals) and potentially harmful (e.g. Cd
and Pb) compounds in crops and crop-based foods(

7

,

19

–

22

). However, there is increasing evidence and more widespread acceptance that the
consumption of organic foods is likely to reduce exposure to pesticide residues(

21

,

23

,

24

).

There are major research synthesis challenges to assessing differences in crop composition
resulting from farming practices. Most importantly, the studies available for meta-analyses (1)
have used different experimental designs (e.g. replicated field experiments, farm surveys and
retail surveys) and (2) have been carried out in countries/regions with contrasting agronomic and
pedo-climatic background conditions (see the online supplementary material for a list of
publications). This heterogeneity is likely to increase the amount of published data required to
detect and understand variation in composition parameters resulting from the use of contrasting
crop production methods. An additional problem is that many studies do not report measures of
variation, which reduces the within-study power of unweighted analyses and the between-study
power of weighted analyses. Weighted meta-analyses are widely regarded as the most appropriate
statistical approach for comparing data sets from studies with variable experimental
designs(

25

,

26

). However, some studies have used unweighted analytical methods(

19

) to avoid the loss of information associated with conducting weighted meta-analyses
on a subset of the available information.

Therefore, the main objectives of the present study were to (1) carry out a systematic
literature review of studies focused on quantifying composition differences between organic and
conventional crops, (2) conduct weighted and unweighted meta-analyses of the published data, (3)
carry out sensitivity analyses focused on identifying to what extent meta-analysis results are
affected by the inclusion criteria (e.g. using mean or individual data reported for different
crop varieties or experimental years) and meta-analysis method (e.g. weighted v.
unweighted), and (4) discuss meta-analysis results in the context of the current knowledge about
the nutritional impacts of compounds for which significant composition differences were detected.

The present study specifically focused on plant secondary metabolites (especially
antioxidants/(poly)phenolics and vitamins), potentially harmful synthetic chemical pesticides,
toxic metals (including Cd, As and Pb), , nitrite (), macronutrients (including proteins, amino acids, carbohydrates and reducing
sugars) and minerals (including all plant macro- and micronutrients). Metabolites produced by
micro-organisms on plants (e.g. mycotoxins) were not the subject of the present systematic
literature review and meta-analyses.

The literature search strategy and meta-analysis protocols used were based on those
previously published by Brandt et al.
(

27

), and flow diagrams of the protocols used are shown in Figs. 1 and ​and2.2. Relevant publications
were identified through an initial search of the literature with Web of Knowledge using the
following search terms: (1) organic* or ecologic* or biodynamic*; (2) conventional* or
integrated; (3) names of ninety-eight relevant crops and foods (see online supplementary Table
S1 for a full list). Publications in all languages, published in peer-reviewed journals, and
reporting data on both desirable and undesirable composition parameters were considered
relevant for inclusion in the meta-analyses. The search was restricted to the period between
January 1992 (the year when legally binding organic farming regulations were first introduced
in the European Union) and December 2011 (the year when the project ended) and provided 17 333
references. An additional 208 publications (published between 1977 and 2011) were found by (1)
studying lists of references or (2) directly contacting the authors of the published papers and
reviews identified in the initial literature search. The abstracts of all publications were
then examined to determine whether they contained original data obtained by comparing
composition parameters in organic and conventional plant foods. This led to the identification
of 448 suitable publications. Of these, 105 papers were subsequently rejected, because reading
of the full papers indicated that they did not report suitable data sets or contained the same
data as other studies.

meta-analyses. * Review carried out by one reviewer; † Data extraction carried out by two
reviewers. CF, comparison of matched farms; BS, basket studies; EX, controlled field

Data sets were deemed suitable if the mean concentrations of at least one mineral,
macronutrient, secondary metabolite or / or the frequency of occurrence of pesticide residues in organic and
conventional crops or crop-based foods were reported. Only four non-peer-reviewed papers with
suitable data sets were identified but subsequently rejected, as the small number minimised any
potential bias(

28

) from using peer review as a ‘quality’ selection criterion.

As a result, 343 peer-reviewed publications reporting crop composition data were selected for
data extraction, of which 156 references fulfilled the criteria for inclusion in the standard
weighted meta-analysis and 343 fulfilled the criteria for inclusion in the standard unweighted
meta-analysis. This represents a significantly greater evidence base than the three previous
systematic reviews/meta-analyses of comparative crop composition data(

19

–

21

). All publications included in these previous reviews (including studies published
before 1992) were also used in the standard weighted meta-analysis carried out in the present
study, except for a small number of papers that were found to report the same data as other
publications that had already been included.

Data were extracted from three types of comparative studies: (1) comparisons of matched farms
(CF), farm surveys in which samples were collected from organic and conventional farms in the
same country or region; (2) basket studies (BS), retail product surveys in which organic and
conventional products were collected in retail outlets; (3) controlled field experiments (EX)
in which samples were collected from experimental plots managed according to organic or
conventional farming standards/protocols. Data from all the three types of studies were deemed
relevant for the meta-analyses if the authors stated that (1) organic farms included in farm
surveys were using organic farming methods, (2) organic products collected in retail surveys
were labelled as organic, and (3) organic plots used in EX were managed according to organic
farming standards.

Several studies compared more than one organic or conventional system or treatment. For
example, additional conventional systems/treatments were described as ‘integrated,’ ‘low
input,’ ‘low fertility’ or ‘extensive’, and an additional organic system/treatment included in
some studies was described as ‘biodynamic’. Also, in some publications, organic or conventional
systems with contrasting rotation designs (e.g. with or without cover crops) or fertilisation
regimens (different types and levels of N inputs) were compared. In such cases, only the
organic and conventional (non-organic) system identified by the authors as closest to the
typical, contemporary organic/conventional farming system was used in the meta-analyses, as
recommended by Brandt et al.
(

20

). Full references of the publications and a summary of descriptions of the studies
included in the meta-analyses are given in Tables S2 and S4 (available online).

The database generated and used for the meta-analyses will be made freely available on the
Newcastle University website (http://research.ncl.ac.uk/nefg/QOF) for use and scrutiny by
others.

Information and data were extracted from all the selected publications (see above) and
compiled in a Microsoft Access database. A list of the information extracted from the
publications and recorded in the database is given in Table S4 (available online).

Data reported as numerical values in the text or tables were copied directly into the
database. Only data published in graphical form were enlarged, printed, measured (using a
ruler) and then entered into the database as described previously(

20

).

Where data for multiple time points were reported, two approaches were used, depending on
whether the analysed crop tissue was likely to be used as food/feed. For crops that are
continuously harvested (e.g. tomato and cucumber), analytical data for mature/ripe products
(e.g. fruits) collected at multiple time points during the season were averaged before being
used in the standard meta-analyses; if analytical data for immature/unripe products were
reported, they were not included in the mean. For crops (e.g. grape and cereals) in which
products (e.g. fruits and grain) are harvested/analysed at different maturity stages, only
analytical results for the mature product (that would have been used as food/feed) were used.
In both the standard weighted and standard unweighted analyses, composition data reported for
different cultivars/varieties and/or years/growing seasons in the same publication were
averaged before being used in the meta-analyses.

Publications were assessed for eligibility and data were independently extracted from them by
two reviewers. Data extracted by the two reviewers were then compared. Discrepancies were
detected for approximately 2 % of the data extracted, and in these cases, data extraction was
repeated to correct mistakes. A list of the publications included in the meta-analyses is given
in Table S2 (available online).

Study characteristics, summaries of the methods used for sensitivity analyses and ancillary
information are given in Tables S2–S10 (available online). These include information on (1) the
number of papers from different countries and publication years used in the meta-analyses (see
online supplementary Figs. S1 and S2); (2) study type, location and crop/products assessed in
different studies (see online supplementary Table S3); (3) the type of material/data extracted
from the papers (see online supplementary Table S4); (4) data-handling methods/inclusion
criteria and meta-analysis methods used in the sensitivity analyses (see online supplementary
Table S5); (5) composition parameters included in the meta-analyses (see online supplementary
Table S6); and (6) composition parameters for which meta-analyses were not possible
(n< 3; see online supplementary Table S7).

Table S8 (available online) summarises basic statistics on the number of studies, individual
comparisons, organic and conventional sample sizes, and comparisons showing statistically or
numerically higher concentrations in organic or conventional crops for the composition
parameters included in Figs. 3 and ​and4.4. Tables S9 and S10 (available online) summarise the numerical values for
the mean percentage differences (MPD) and 95 % CI calculated using the data included in the
standard unweighted and weighted meta-analyses of composition parameters shown in Figs. 3 and ​and4,

respectively (where MPD are shown as symbols).

A total of eight different meta-analyses were undertaken. The protocols used for the standard
weighted and unweighted meta-analyses were based on the methodologies described by Palupi
et al.
(

29

) and Brandt et al.
(

20

), respectively. In Fig. 3, the results
obtained using standard random-effects meta-analysis weighted by inverse variance and a common
random-effects variance component and unweighted meta-analysis of difference in means are
shown. In addition, six sensitivity analyses were undertaken. Sensitivity analyses included (1)
using data reported for each cultivar or variety of crops separately and/or (2) treating data
reported for different years in the same publication as separate events in the weighted or
unweighted meta-analyses (see online supplementary Table S5). The results of the sensitivity
analyses are available on the Newcastle University website (http://research.ncl.ac.uk/nefg/QOF).

Effect sizes for all the weighted meta-analyses were based on standardised mean differences
(SMD) as recommended for studies in which data obtained by measuring the same parameters on
different scales are included in meta-analyses(

25

,

26

).

Both weighted and unweighted meta-analyses were carried out using the R statistical
programming environment(

30

). Weighted meta-analyses, with the SMD as the basic response variable, were
conducted using standard methods and the open-source ‘metafor’ statistical package(

31

–

34

). A detailed description of the methods and calculations used is given in the
‘Additional Methods Description’ section in the online supplementary material.

A positive SMD value indicates that the mean concentrations of the observed compound are
greater in the organic food samples, while a negative SMD indicates that the mean
concentrations are higher in the conventional food samples. The statistical significance of a
reported effect size (i.e. SMDtot) and CI were estimated based on standard
methods(

35

) using ‘metafor’(

31

). The influence of potential moderators, such as crop/food type (fruits,
vegetables, cereals, oil seeds and pulses, herbs and spices, and crop-based compound foods),
was additionally tested using mixed-effect models(

36

) and subgroup analyses.

We carried out tests of homogeneity (Q statistics and I
2 statistics) on all the summary effect sizes. Homogeneity was indicated if
I
2 was less than 25 % and the P value for the Q
statistics was greater than 0·010. Funnel plots, Egger tests of funnel plot asymmetry and
fail-safe number tests were used to assess publication bias(

37

) (see online supplementary Table S13 for further information).

For the unweighted meta-analysis, the ratio of organic means:conventional means () expressed as a percentage was ln-transformed, and the values were used to
determine whether the arithmetic average of the ln-transformed ratios was significantly greater
than ln(100), using resampling(

38

). The reported P values were derived from Fisher's one-sample
randomisation test(

39

), and a P< 0·05 was considered statistically significant.
For all composition parameters for which a statistically significant difference between organic
and conventional food samples was detected in the standard weighted analysis (analysis 1),
forest plots were constructed to show SMD and corresponding 95 % CI for individual studies and
types of foods (see Fig. 4 and online supplementary
Figs. S5–S41). In addition, the results of the standard unweighted analyses are shown in Figs. 3 and ​and44.

Table S12 (available online) summarises the results of the standard weighted and unweighted
meta-analyses for all the composition parameters for which no analyses detected significant
differences between organic and conventional products.

MPD were calculated for all parameters for which significant effects were detected by the
standard unweighted and/or weighted meta-analysis protocols. This was done to facilitate value
judgements regarding the biological importance of the relative effect magnitudes. A detailed
description of the calculations is given in the ‘Additional Methods Description’ section in the
online supplementary material.

We also calculated MPD using only data pairs included in the weighted meta-analyses to
estimate the impact of excluding data for which no measures of variance were reported on the
magnitude of difference. As the MPD can be expressed as ‘% higher’ in conventional or organic
crops, they provide estimates for the magnitude of composition differences that are easier to
correlate with existing information on the potential health impacts of changing dietary intake
levels for individual or groups of compounds than the SMD values. The 95 % CI for MPD were
estimated using a standard method(

35

).

For some composition parameters, individual effect sizes were more than fifty times greater
than the pooled effect. This applied to one effect size each for phenolic acids, flavanones,
flavones, flavonols, carbohydrates, DM and ; four effect sizes for carotenoids and xanthophylls; eight effect sizes for
amino acids; and forty-one effect sizes for volatile compounds. Such large differences can be
considered biologically implausible, and these ‘outlier’ data pairs were therefore omitted from
the final standard meta-analyses as shown in Figs. 3 and
​and44 and Tables S10 and S11 (available online).

Data reported for the frequency of occurrence of detectable pesticide residues (percentage of
samples with detectable pesticide residues) in organic and conventional crops were compared
using a weighted meta-analysis protocol based on the ln-transformed OR(

40

). The formula used to calculate OR is given in the ‘Additional Methods Description’
section in the online supplementary material.

An overall assessment of the strength of evidence was made using an adaptation of the GRADE
(Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system(

41

).

Analyses were based on data from publications reporting results from EX (154 papers), CF (116
papers), and BS (fifty-five papers) or results from more than one type of study (EX, CF and/or
BS; eighteen papers) (see online supplementary Table S3).

Approximately 70 % of all the studies included in the meta-analyses were carried out in
Europe, mainly in Italy, Spain, Poland, Sweden, the Czech Republic, Switzerland, Turkey,
Denmark, Finland and Germany, with most of the remaining studies being carried out in the USA,
Brazil, Canada and Japan (see online supplementary Table S3 and Fig. S2). Among the papers
included in the meta-analyses, 174 reported comparison data for vegetables and a smaller number
reported data for fruits and cereals (112 and sixty-one, respectively), while only thirty-seven
reported data for other crops/crop-based food products (e.g. oil seeds and pulses, herbs and
spices, and compound foods) (see online supplementary Table S3). Publications reported data for
907 different composition parameters, of which 182 were included in the meta-analyses (see
online supplementary Tables S6 and S7).

A large number of comparisons were available for antioxidant activity in organic and
conventional crops (160 for the unweighted meta-analysis and sixty-six for the weighted
meta-analysis), but the authors used a wide range of different methodologies. Both weighted and
unweighted meta-analyses detected a significantly higher antioxidant activity in organic crops
(Fig. 3) and the MPD was 17 (95 % CI 3, 32) % (Fig. 3).

When data reported for fruits and vegetables were analysed separately, a significant
difference was detected for fruits, while only a trend towards a significant difference
(P= 0·06) was observed for vegetables (Fig.
4), although there was no evidence of an interaction.

When data available for specific antioxidant activity assays were analysed, similar results
were obtained for the Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity assay with both the standard
weighted and unweighted meta-analyses and for the ferric reducing antioxidant power and oxygen
radical absorbance capacity assays with only the standard unweighted meta-analysis (Fig. 3).

The concentrations of secondary metabolites with antioxidant activity, including a wide range
of nutritionally desirable (poly)phenolics, were also studied in a relatively large number of
studies (see online supplementary Table S8).

For (poly)phenolics, the standard weighted meta-analysis detected significantly and
substantially higher concentrations of total flavonoids, total phenolic acids, phenolic acids
(where data reported for all individual phenolic acid compounds were included in the same
analysis), flavanones, stilbenes, flavones, flavonols, kaempferol, total anthocyanins and
anthocyanins in organic crops and/or processed foods made from organic crops. The unweighted
meta-analysis yielded similar results, except for (1) total flavonoids, for which no
significant difference was detected, and (2) flavanones and flavones, for which only trends
towards higher concentrations in organic crops were detected (Fig. 3). The unweighted meta-analysis also detected significantly higher
concentrations of chlorogenic acid (5-O-caffeoylquinic acid) in organic crops
(Fig. 3). The MPD for most of the compounds were
between 18 and 69 % for most of the above-mentioned antioxidant compounds (Fig. 3). Inclusion of data for which no measures of variance were reported
in the calculation of MPD yielded similar values for phenolic compounds, phenolic acids,
chlorogenic acid, flavones, quercetin, kaempferol and anthocyanins; higher values for phenolic
acids (total), stilbenes and quercetin-3-rutinoside; and lower values for flavonoids,
flavanones and flavonols (see Fig. 4 and online
supplementary Table S9).

When data reported for phenolic compounds, phenolic acids and flavanones in fruits,
vegetables, cereals and/or processed crop-based foods were analysed separately, significant
differences were detected only for the concentrations of phenolic compounds and phenolic acids
in fruits and a trend towards a significant difference (P= 0·09) was detected
for the concentrations of flavanones in fruits (Fig. 4),
although there was no evidence of an interaction. In contrast, when differences in the
concentrations of flavones and flavonols were analysed separately for fruits, vegetables and
cereals, significant differences were detected for vegetables and cereals, but not for fruits,
with evidence of interactions (Fig. 4). For all other
antioxidant/(poly)phenolic compounds, separate analyses for different crop types were not
possible due to the unavailability of sufficient data.

Smaller, but statistically significant and biologically meaningful composition differences
were also detected for a small number of carotenoids and vitamins. Both unweighted and weighted
meta-analyses detected significantly higher concentrations of xanthophylls and
l-ascorbic acid and significantly lower concentrations of vitamin E in organic crops.
Higher concentrations of total carotenoids, carotenoids (where data reported for all individual
phenolic acid compounds were included in the same analysis) and lutein were also detected by
the unweighted meta-analysis (Fig. 3). The MPD were 17
(95 % CI 0, 34) % for total carotenoids, 15 (95 % CI − 3, 32) % for carotenoids (where data
reported for all individual carotenoid compounds were included in the same analysis), 12 (95 %
CI − 4, 28) % for xanthophylls, 5 (95 % CI − 3, 13) % for lutein, 6 (95 % CI − 3, 15) % for
vitamin C and − 15 (95 % CI − 49, 19) % for vitamin E. Inclusion of data for which no measures
of variance were reported in the calculation of MPD resulted in slightly higher values (see
Fig. 4 and online supplementary Table S9).

When data reported for total carotenoids and xanthophylls in fruits, vegetables, cereals and
processed crop-based compound foods were analysed separately, significantly higher
concentrations in organic samples were detected only for fruits (Fig. 4), with evidence of interactions being detected for carotenoids, but
not for xanthophylls.

The meta-analyses did not detect significant differences for a range of other secondary
metabolites with antioxidant activity. These included some individual carotenoids (α-carotene,
lycopene, β-cryptoxanthin and zeaxanthin), vitamins (α-tocopherol, γ-tocopherol, vitamin B and
vitamin B1), some specific phenolic acids (total hydroxycinnamic acids, caffeic
acid, p-coumaric acid, ferulic acid, sinapic acid,
5-O-caffeoylquinic acid, ellagic acid, gallic acid and salicylic acid), some
specific flavones and flavonols (apigenin, luteolin, myricetin 3-O-glucoside,
quercetin 3-O-galactoside, quercetin-3-O-glucoside and
quercetin-3-O-malonyl glucoside) and some specific flavanones (naringenin and
naringenin (R-enantiomer)).

Both unweighted and weighted meta-analyses detected significantly higher concentrations of
total carbohydrates and significantly lower concentrations of proteins, amino acids and fibre
in organic crops/crop-based compound foods (Fig. 3). The
unweighted meta-analysis also detected significantly higher concentrations of reducing sugars
and DM in organic crops (Fig. 4). The MPD were 25 (95 %
CI 5, 45) % for total carbohydrates, 11 (95 % CI 2, 20) % for carbohydrates (where data
reported for all individual phenolic acid compounds were included in the same analysis), 7
(95 % CI 4, 11) % for reducing sugars, − 15 (95 % CI − 27, − 3) % for proteins, − 11 (95 % CI
− 14, − 8) % for amino acids, 2 (95 % CI − 1, 6) % for DM and − 8 (95 % CI − 14, − 2) % for
fibre. Inclusion of data for which no measures of variance were reported in the calculation of
MPD resulted in similar values for carbohydrates, proteins, DM and fibre; higher values for
reducing sugars; and lower values for carbohydrates (total) and amino acids (see Fig. 4 and online supplementary Table S9).

When data reported for proteins and amino acids in vegetables, cereals and/or processed
crop-based foods were analysed separately, significant differences were detected for cereals
and processed crop-based foods, but not for vegetables (Fig.
4), although there was no evidence of an interaction. Also, when data reported for
carbohydrates in vegetables, fruits and cereals were analysed separately, no significant
effects could be detected in their concentrations (Fig.
4).

Both weighted and unweighted meta-analyses detected significantly lower concentrations of the
toxic metal Cd and total N in organic crops, while lower concentrations of  and  in organic crops were detected only by the unweighted meta-analysis (Fig. 3). The MPD were − 48 (95 % CI − 112, 16) % for Cd, − 10
(95 % CI − 15, − 4) % for N, − 30 (95 % CI − 144, 84) % for  and − 87 (95 % CI − 225, 52) % for  (Fig. 3).

Inclusion of data for which no measures of variance were reported in the calculation of MPD
resulted in similar values for N, ,  and Cd (see Fig. 4 and online
supplementary Table S9).

When data reported for N and Cd concentrations in fruits, vegetables and cereals were
analysed separately, significant differences were detected for cereals, but not for vegetables
and/or fruits (Fig. 4), although there was no evidence
of an interaction.

For the toxic metals As and Pb, no significant differences could be detected in their
concentrations between organic and conventional crops in the meta-analyses (see online
supplementary Table S12).

The standard meta-analyses showed that the frequency of occurrence of detectable pesticide
residues was four times higher in conventional crops (46 (95 % CI 38, 55) %) than in organic
crops (11 (95 % CI 7, 14) %) (Fig. 5). Significantly
higher frequencies of occurrence of pesticide residues in conventional crops were also detected
when data reported for fruits, vegetables and processed crop-based foods were analysed
separately (Fig. 5). Conventional fruits had a higher
frequency (75 (95 % CI 65, 85) %) of occurrence of pesticide residues than vegetables (32 (95 %
CI 22, 43) %) and crop-based compound foods (45 (95 % CI 25, 65) %), while contamination rates
were very similar in the different organic crop types. This resulted in significant differences
in the OR for different crop types (Fig. 5).

For most of the minerals (including many plant marco- and micronutrients), the meta-analyses
could not detect significant composition differences between organic and conventional crops
(see online supplementary Table S12). However, for a small number of minerals, differences in
composition were identified by both weighted and unweighted meta-analyses, which detected
significantly lower concentrations of Cr and Sr ( − 59 (95 % CI − 147, 30) % and − 26 (95 % CI
− 45, − 6) %, respectively), but significantly higher concentrations of Mo and Rb (65 (95 % CI
26, 105) % and 82 (95 % CI 6, 157) %, respectively) in organic crops. Also, lower
concentrations of Mn ( − 8 (95 % CI − 13, − 3) %) and higher concentrations of Ga and Mg in
organic crops (57 (95 % CI − 122, 8) % and 4 (95 % CI − 5, 13) %, respectively) were detected
only by the weighted meta-analysis, while slightly higher concentrations of Zn (5 (95 % CI − 6,
15) %) in organic crops were only detected by the unweighted meta-analysis (see online
supplementary Table S11). As differences for Zn and Mg were relatively small and as there is
limited information about potential health impacts associated with changing intake levels of
either mineral (Cr, Ga, Mo, Sr and Mo), more detailed results are provided only in the online
supplementary material.

Heterogeneity was extremely high (I
2>75 %) for most of the composition parameters, with I
2 ranging from 76 % for ascorbic acid to 100 % for carotenoids and DM (Fig. 3). The only exceptions were vitamin E, reducing sugars,
fibre and , for which the small number of studies and/or high within-study variability
limited the ability to distinguish heterogeneity between the effects.

Strong or moderate funnel plot asymmetry consistent with a publication bias was detected for
approximately half of the parameters. However, it is not possible to definitively attribute
discrepancies between large precise studies and small imprecise studies to publication bias,
which remains strongly suspected rather than detected where asymmetry is severe (see Table 1 and online supplementary Table S13).


GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessments, Development and Evaluation) assessment of
the strength of evidence for standard weighted meta-analysis for parameters included in
Fig. 3 (Standardised mean difference values (SMD)
and 95 % confidence intervals)

FRAP, ferric reducing antioxidant potential; ORAC, oxygen radical absorbance capacity;
TEAC, Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity.

When meta-analysis results obtained from different study types (BS, CF and EX) were compared,
similar results were obtained for most of the composition parameters included in Fig. 3 (see online supplementary Figs. S3 and S4). However,
there was considerable variation between results obtained for different crop types, crop
species, and/or studies carried out in countries with contrasting pedo-climatic and agronomic
background conditions (see Fig. 4 and online
supplementary Figs. S5–S41).

Non-weighted MPD were calculated to aid in the biological interpretation of effect size
magnitude where either the weighted or unweighted meta-analysis had identified statistically
significant results. For many parameters, MPD based on all the available data produced values
very similar to those calculated using only data for which measures of variance were reported
( = those used for the weighted meta-analysis; Fig. 3).
However, for other parameters (flavonoids, total phenolic acids, flavanones, rutin,
l-ascorbic acid, reducing sugars and Cd), inclusion criteria had a large effect on the
MPD.

Also, when the calculated MPD were superimposed onto SMD (with 95 % CI) results at an
appropriate scale ( − 100 to +100 for MPD and − 5 to +5 for SMD), a reasonable match was
observed, with MPD for most of the compounds being present within the 95 % CI for SMD (Fig. 3). However, for some parameters (Trolox equivalent
antioxidant capacity, total phenolic acids, stilbenes, rutin, total carotenoids,
l-ascorbic acid, vitamin E, reducing sugars, proteins, ,  and Cd), MPD were outside the 95 % CI of SMD, and therefore these should be
seen as less reliable.

For the composition parameters included in Fig. 3,
sensitivity analyses, which were based on different inclusion criteria and data-handling
methods, yielded results broadly similar to those yielded by the standard weighted and
unweighted meta-analyses.

The overall assessment of the strength of evidence using an adapted GRADE(

41

) approach highlighted uncertainties in the evidence base, but the overall strength
of evidence was moderate or high for the majority of parameters for which significant
differences were detected (see Table 1 and online
supplementary Table S13).

The results of meta-analyses of the extensive data set of 343 peer-reviewed publications
indicated that organic crops and processed crop-based foods have a higher antioxidant activity
and contain higher concentrations of a wide range of nutritionally desirable
antioxidants/(poly)phenolics, but lower concentrations of the potentially harmful, toxic metal
Cd. For plant secondary metabolites, this confirms the results of the meta-analyses carried out
by Brandt et al.
(

20

), which indicated that there are significant composition differences between organic
and conventional crops for a range of nutritionally relevant compounds. However, it contradicts
the results of the systematic reviews/meta-analyses by Dangour et al.
(

19

) and Smith-Spangler et al.
(

21

), which indicated that there are no significant composition differences between
organic and conventional crops. The main reason for the inability of previous studies to detect
composition differences was probably the highly limited number of studies/data sets available or
included in analyses by these authors, which would have decreased the statistical power of the
meta-analyses.

In addition, most of the previous studies did not use weighted meta-analyses based on SMD.
This approach is recommended when combining data from studies that measure the same parameter
(e.g. the major phenolic compounds found in different crops), but use different scales(

25

,

26

,

29

). In the study carried out by Dangour et al.
(

19

), published data from (1) surveys in which the organic samples were produced to
‘biodynamic-organic’ standards and (2) field experiments investigating associations between
organic and conventional production protocols and crop composition were not included in the
meta-analyses. This would have further reduced the number of data sets and sensitivity of
meta-analyses and contributed to the lack of significant composition differences being detected.
In the meta-analyses carried out in the present study, ‘biodynamic-organic’ data sets were
treated as organic, as biodynamic standards comply with the legal European Union organic farming
standards. Data from comparative field experiments were also included, as controlled
experimental studies are less affected by confounding factors (e.g. contrasting soil and
climatic and agronomic background conditions between farms that supplied organic and
conventional samples) than farm and retail surveys. The reason for excluding field experiments
carried out in the study of Dangour et al.
(

19

) is that in the field experiments the organic plots were not certified according to
organic farming standards. In the meta-analyses carried out in the present study, field
experiments investigating associations between organic and conventional agronomic
practices/protocols and crop composition were included, as the crop management practices rather
than the certification process were assumed to affect crop performance and composition.

The finding of a four times higher frequency of occurrence of pesticide residues in
conventional crops confirms the results of the study of Smith-Spangler et al.
(

21

), in which a very similar set of studies (nine of the ten publications used in the
present study) were used for analysis.

The potential (1) nutritional benefits of higher concentrations of antioxidant/(poly)phenolics
in organic crops, (2) risks associated with potentially harmful pesticide residues, Cd,  and , and (3) agronomic factors responsible for composition differences are
discussed in more detail below.

Among the composition differences detected by the meta-analyses carried out in the present
study, the higher antioxidant activity and higher concentrations of a wide range of
antioxidants/(poly)phenolics found in organic crops/crop-based foods may indicate the greatest
potential nutritional benefits. Based on the differences reported, results indicate that a
switch from conventional to organic crop consumption would result in a 20–40 % (and for some
compounds more than 60 %) increase in crop-based antioxidant/(poly)phenolic intake levels
without a simultaneous increase in energy, which would be in line with the dietary
recommendations(

16

,

17

). This estimated magnitude of difference would be equivalent to the amount of
antioxidants/(poly)phenolics present in one to two of the five portions of fruits and
vegetables recommended to be consumed daily and would therefore be significant/meaningful in
terms of human nutrition, if information linking these plant secondary metabolites to the
health benefits associated with increased fruit, vegetable and whole grain consumption is
confirmed(

16

–

18

).

However, it is important to point out that there is still a lack of knowledge about the
potential human health impacts of increasing antioxidant/(poly)phenolic intake levels and
switching to organic food consumption. For example, there are still gaps in the understanding
of the (1) uptake, bioavailability and metabolism of (poly)phenolics after ingestion and (2)
exact compounds/molecules and modes of action responsible for health benefits(

16

). Also, it is important to consider that most of the human dietary intervention
studies on associations between antioxidant/(poly)phenolic intake and health indicators were
based on the comparison of standard diets with diets in which the amount of specific
(poly)phenolic-rich foods (e.g. cocoa, red wine, tea/coffee, berries, citrus and nuts) was
high(

16

,

17

).

There are, to our knowledge, only two human dietary intervention studies in which contrasting
antioxidant/(poly)phenolic intake levels were generated by providing diets based on
conventional and organic crops; both studies focused on assessing antioxidant status in humans
and were inconclusive with respect to the identification of potential health impacts of organic
food consumption(

21

,

42

,

43

). However, there are several animal dietary intervention studies that have
identified significant associations between organic feed consumption and animal growth and
physiological (including immune and endocrine) parameters and/or biomarkers of health when
compared with conventional feed consumption(

44

,

45

). Among these studies, one recent factorial animal study has gone one step further
and assessed associations between contrasting crop fertilisation and crop protection protocols
used in conventional and organic farming systems and (1) the composition (including
(poly)phenolic content) of crops/compound feeds made from crops and (2) the growth,
physiological, immunological and hormonal parameters of rats that consumed these feeds(

46

). With respect to composition differences, the study yielded results similar to
those of the meta-analyses carried out in the present study. For example, rat feeds produced
from organic crops had lower concentrations of proteins and Cd, but higher concentrations of
polyphenols and the carotenoid lutein. The study also demonstrated that composition differences
were mainly linked to contrasting fertilisation regimens (green and animal manures
v. mineral fertiliser inputs). The consumption of feeds made from organic
crops by the rats resulted in higher levels of body protein, body ash, leucocyte count, plasma
glucose, leptin, insulin-like growth factor 1, corticosterone, and IgM, and spontaneous
lymphocyte proliferation, but lower levels of plasma IgG, testosterone and mitogen-stimulated
proliferation of lymphocytes(

46

). Redundancy analysis identified total polyphenol concentrations in feeds as the
strongest driver for the physiological/endocrinological parameters assessed in rats. This
suggests that a switch from conventional to organic crop consumption may have impacts similar
to those of an increase in the intake of foods with high antioxidant/(poly)phenolic contents.
This hypothesis would merit further exploration in animal and human dietary intervention
studies.

Many of the antioxidants, including (poly)phenolics, found in higher concentrations in
organic crops are known to be produced by plants in response to abiotic (e.g. wounding and
heat, water and nutrient stress) and biotic (pest attacks and disease) stress and form part of
the plants' constitutive and inducible resistance mechanisms to pests and diseases(

47

–

49

). Therefore, higher concentrations of (poly)phenolics in organic crops may be due
to higher incidence/severity of pest and disease damage, causing enhanced (poly)phenolic
production as part of the inducible plant resistance response. The differences in antioxidant
concentrations between organic and conventional crops may therefore have been due to
contrasting pest and disease damage and/or fertilisation intensity. However, there are, to our
knowledge, no sound published data/evidence for a causal link between higher pest/disease
incidence/severity and antioxidant/(poly)phenolic concentrations in organic crops. In contrast,
there is increasing evidence that differences in fertilisation regimens between organic and
conventional production systems (and, in particular, the non-use of high mineral N fertiliser
inputs) are significant drivers for higher (poly)phenolic concentrations in organic crops(

20

,

49

–

52

). For example, Sander & Heitefuss(

50

) reported that increasing mineral N fertilisation resulted in reduced
concentrations of phenolic resistance compounds in wheat leaves and increased severity of
foliar disease (powdery mildew). Similarly, a review by Rühmann et al.
(

51

) describes the negative correlations between N fertilisation/supply-driven shoot
growth and concentrations of phenylpropanoids and apple scab resistance in young leaves in
apple trees(

51

). In tomato, deficiency of both N and P was found to be linked to flavonol
accumulation in plant tissues(

52

). More recently, Almuayrifi(

49

) has demonstrated that the non-use of synthetic pesticides and fungicides has no
effect on phenolic acid and flavonoid concentrations and profiles in wheat, but that the use of
standard, conventional mineral (NPK) fertiliser regimens is associated with significantly lower
phenolic acid and flavonoid concentrations in wheat leaves compared with organic wheat crops
fertilised with green and animal manures only. The variability in relative differences in
antioxidant/(poly)phenolic concentrations found between studies and crops may therefore at
least partially be explained by variability in the fertilisation protocols in both the organic
and non-organic systems compared. The finding in the present study that organic crops have
significantly lower N,  and  concentrations would support the theory that differences in
antioxidant/(poly)phenolic concentrations between organic and conventional crops are driven by
contrasting N supply patterns. This view is supported by previous studies that have suggested
that under high N availability, plants allocate carbohydrates from photosynthesis to primary
metabolism and rapid growth while producing less amounts of secondary metabolites involved in
defence(

51

).

However, additional research is required to gain a more detailed understanding of the
relative contribution of fertilisation and crop protection regimens and disease and pest
prevalence/severity to the expression of constitutive and inducible resistance mechanisms in
different organically managed crop plants(

50

).

Cd is a highly toxic metal and one of the only three toxic metal contaminants (the other two
being Pb and Hg) for which the European Commission has set maximum residue levels (MRL) in
foods(

53

). Cd accumulates in the human body (especially in the liver and kidneys) and
therefore dietary Cd intake levels should be kept as low as possible(

53

). The on average 48 % lower Cd concentrations found in organic crops/crop-based
foods in the meta-analyses carried out in the present study are therefore desirable, although
the exact health benefits associated with reducing Cd intake levels via a switch to organic
food consumption are difficult to estimate. Similar to the results of the present study, a
recent literature review by Smith-Spangler et al.
(

21

) has also reported that of the seventy-seven comparative data sets (extracted from
fifteen publications), twenty-one indicated significantly lower and only one significantly
higher Cd concentrations in organic foods. Differences in Cd contamination levels between
organic and conventional winter wheat have recently been shown to be mainly linked to
differences in fertilisation regimens (especially the high mineral P inputs used in
conventional farming systems), although contrasting rotation designs also contributed to
differences in Cd concentrations between organic and conventional wheat(

7

). A range of other soil (e.g. pH) and agronomic (e.g. liming) factors are known to
affect Cd concentrations in crops(

54

), and these may explain the variability in results between individual comparative
studies, crop species and crop types (see Fig. 4 and
online supplementary Figs. S4 and S22).

The present study demonstrated that the prohibition of synthetic chemical pesticide use under
organic farming standards results in a more than 4-fold reduction in the number of crop samples
with detectable pesticide residues. This supports previous studies that have concluded that
organic food consumption can reduce exposure to pesticide residues(

21

–

23

). The considerably higher frequency of occurrence of detectable residues in
conventional fruits (75 %) than in vegetables (32 %) may indicate higher levels of crop
protection inputs being used in fruit crops, but could also have been due to the use of more
persistent chemicals, different sprayer technologies used and/or pesticide applications being
made closer to harvest. The finding of detectable pesticide residues in a proportion (about
11 %) of organic crop samples may have been due to cross-contamination from neighbouring
conventional fields, the continued presence of very persistent pesticides (e.g. organochlorine
compounds) in fields or perennial crop tissues from past conventional management, and/or
accidental or fraudulent use of prohibited pesticides in organic farms.

Pesticide residues that are below the MRL set by the European Commission(

55

,

56

) are considered by regulators not to pose risk to consumers or the environment, as
they are significantly lower than concentrations for which negative health or environmental
impacts can be detected in the regulatory pesticide safety testing carried out as part of the
pesticide approval process(

55

). However, a significant number of crop samples included in the regulatory European
Food Safety Authority pesticide residue monitoring in Europe are still found to contain
pesticide residues above the MRL(

57

). For example, in recent European Food Safety Authority surveys, pesticide residues
above the MRL have been found in 6·2 % of spinach, 3·8 % of oat, 3·4 % of peach, 3·0 % of
orange, 2·9 % of strawberry and lettuce, 2·8 % of table grape and 2·7 % of apple samples
analysed(

57

). There is still scientific controversy about the safety of some currently
permitted pesticides (e.g. organophosphorus compounds) even at levels below the MRL and complex
mixtures of pesticides, as additive/synergistic effects of pesticide mixtures have been
documented and safety testing of pesticide mixtures is currently not required as part of the
regulatory pesticide approval process(

58

–

60

). Similar to Cd, the lower risk of exposure to pesticide residues can be considered
desirable, but potential health benefits associated with reducing pesticide exposure via a
switch to organic food consumption are impossible to estimate.

It should be pointed out that (1) there are only eleven studies in which the frequencies of
occurrence of pesticide residues were compared, (2) eight of these studies focused on only one
crop species, (3) no comparative studies for cereals, oilseeds and pulses were identified in
the literature review, and (4) the data available did not allow scientifically robust
comparisons of the concentrations of pesticides. Therefore, it is important to carry out
further studies to improve our understanding of differences in the frequency of occurrence and
concentrations of pesticide residues between organic and conventional crops.

The concentrations of proteins, amino acids and N (which are known to be positively
correlated in plants) were found to be lower in organic crops, and this is consistent with the
results of previous studies that have linked lower protein concentrations to lower N inputs and
N availability in organic crop production systems(

61

,

62

). The nutritional significance/relevance of slightly lower protein and amino acid
concentrations in organic crops to human health is likely to be low, as European and North
American diets typically provide sufficient or even excessive amounts of proteins and essential
amino acids. Also, while some studies concluded that protein content in most European and North
American diets is too high and that this contributes to the increasing incidence of diabetes
and obesity(

63

), other studies reported that increasing protein intake levels may be a strategy to
prevent obesity(

64

). Therefore, the lower protein and amino acid concentrations found in organic foods
are unlikely to have a significant nutritional or health impact.

The higher  and  concentrations in conventional crops are also thought to be linked to high
mineral N inputs, as both  and  are known to accumulate in plants under high-mineral N input regimens(

65

). The higher  concentrations in conventional crops/crop-based foods are nutritionally
undesirable, as they have been described to be risk factors for stomach cancer and
methaemoglobinaemia in humans(

65

). However, while increasing dietary  intake levels is widely considered to be potentially harmful for human
health, there is still controversy about the potential health impacts of crop-based dietary  intake(

65

–

67

).

One of the main challenges to interpreting comparisons of organic and inorganic food
production systems is the high heterogeneity arising from combinations of (1) crops, crop types
and/or crop-based foods, (2) countries, and/or (3) pedo-climatic and agronomic background
conditions. As has been mentioned in previous reviews(

19

–

21

), pooling diverse information was necessary, because for most of the composition
parameters, the number of published studies available was not sufficient to carry out separate
meta-analyses for specific countries/regions and crop types and species. Consequently,
heterogeneity was extremely high (I
2>75 %) for most of the composition parameters for which significant
differences were detected.

For many composition parameters, the method of synthesis did not have large effects on
results, in terms of both statistical significance and the magnitude of relative difference
between organic and conventional crops. This indicates that there is now a sufficiently large
body of published information to identify differences that are relatively consistent across
study types, crops, and pedo-climatic and agronomic environments. Therefore, for these
parameters, future studies should focus on increasing our understanding of the underlying
agronomic, pedo-climatic and crop genetic factors responsible for composition differences
between organic and conventional crops.

For other composition parameters (e.g. ferric reducing antioxidant power, oxygen radical
absorbance capacity, Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity, and levels of flavonoids,
stilbenes, total carotenoids, l-ascorbic acid, proteins,  and Cd), differences in methods had a large impact in terms of both
significant effects being detected and/or estimates of the magnitude of difference based on MPD
and SMD. For these compounds, additional high-quality studies (that report measures of
variance) are required to increase the power of weighted meta-analyses.

Overall assessment of the strength of evidence for antioxidant/(poly)phenolic parameters
indicated high or moderate reliability for thirteen of the nineteen parameters and moderate
reliability for Cd. This supports the conclusion that future research would likely be
confirmatory.

In contrast to previous literature reviews(

19

–

21

), the larger number of studies now available allowed separate meta-analyses to be
carried out for different crop types (e.g. fruits, vegetables and cereals), but only for a
limited number of composition parameters. This demonstrates that there is variation between
crop types with respect to (1) whether the production system has a significant effect and/or
(2) the magnitude of difference between organic and conventional crops, although sample sizes
remain insufficient to detect interactions between crop types in many cases.

The present study also identified variation between studies (1) carried out in countries with
different pedo-climatic conditions and agronomic protocols (e.g. rotation designs, irrigated or
non-irrigated crop production, and level and type of animal manures used) and/or (2) focused on
different crop species. This is not surprising as both genetic and environmental/agronomic
factors are known to affect the concentrations of N, , , proteins, sugars, antioxidants/(poly)phenolics, Cd and pesticides in
crops(

7

,

9

–

12

,

20

,

47

–

52

,

62

). However, due to the lack of detailed information on agronomic and pedo-climatic
background conditions in most of the available literature, it is currently not possible to
quantify the relative contribution of genetic and environmental/agronomic sources of variation.

The unweighted MPD were calculated to provide an estimate of the magnitude of difference that
is meaningful when considering nutritional/health impacts of changes in crop composition.
However, care should be taken when interpreting MPD values, as they do not take variability in
the precision of individual studies into account(

25

) and provide less precise estimates of effect than weighted estimates.

However, there is now evidence from a large number of quality studies that consistently show
that organic production systems result in crops/crop-based compound foods with higher
concentrations of antioxidants/(poly)phenolics and lower concentrations of Cd and pesticide
residues compared with conventional production systems. There is little uncertainty surrounding
this overall result, but further research is required to quantify more accurately the relative
impacts of (1) crop types, species, and varieties/cultivars/hybrids and (2) agronomic and
pedo-climatic background conditions on the relative difference between organic and conventional
crop composition.

The present study identified deficiencies in a large proportion of the published studies.
These included a lack of standardised measurements and a lack of reporting (and, in particular,
the non-reporting of measures of variability and/or replication) for many composition
parameters, and there was evidence of duplicate or selective reporting of data collected in
experiments, which may lead to publication bias. Particularly, there is a lack of studies
comparing pesticide residue levels in organic and conventional crops, and there has been very
little effort taken to re-analyse and then publish available comparative data from food
surveillance surveys (e.g. the regular pesticide residue and food composition surveys carried
out by the European Food Safety Authority and national agencies in Europe and elsewhere). Also,
in many studies, there was a lack of detailed information on (1) the geographical origin of
samples in retail surveys and (2) agronomic (e.g. rotation, fertilisation, tillage and
irrigation regimens), pedo-climatic and crop genetic backgrounds (in farm surveys and field
experiments), which would allow potential sources of variation to be investigated.

Not all studies included in the meta-analyses used certified reference materials as a quality
assurance measure for the accuracy of estimates of concentrations of compounds in crops. This
is unlikely to have affected the estimates of relative differences between organic and
conventional crops, as the same extraction and analytical methods were used for organic and
conventional samples in all the studies included in the meta-analyses in the present study.
However, data from studies that did not use reference materials are less reliable when used to
estimate the concentrations of nutritionally relevant compounds in crops and total dietary
intake levels of such compounds in crop-based foods.

Therefore, it is important to develop guidelines for studies comparing the impacts of
agronomic practices on crop/food composition to minimise heterogeneity and/or allow agronomic,
environmental and crop genetic drivers to be used as covariates in analyses.

A recent review by Smith-Spangler et al.
(

21

) has analysed the results of fourteen studies in which the effects of organic and
conventional food (both crop and livestock product) consumption on clinical outcomes (e.g.
allergic symptoms and Campylobacter infections) and health markers (e.g. serum
lipid and vitamin concentrations) were studied. However, they concluded that the currently
available data do not allow clear trends with respect to health markers and outcomes to be
identified. Therefore, there is an urgent need for well-controlled human intervention and/or
cohort studies to identify/quantify potential human health impacts of organic
v. conventional food consumption.

Diet composition may have an effect on the relative impact of switching from conventional to
organic food consumption, and this should be considered in the design of such studies. For
example, the relative impact of switching from conventional to organic food consumption could
be expected to be smaller for diets with high amounts of (poly)phenolic-rich foods.

Demand for organic foods is partially driven by consumers' perceptions that they are more
nutritious. However, scientific opinion is divided on whether there are significant nutritional
differences between organic and non-organic foods, and two recent reviews have concluded that
there are no differences. In the present study, we carried out meta-analyses based on 343
peer-reviewed publications that indicate statistically significant and meaningful differences
in composition between organic and non-organic crops/crop-based foods. Most importantly, the
concentrations of a range of antioxidants such as polyphenolics were found to be substantially
higher in organic crops/crop-based foods, with those of phenolic acids, flavanones, stilbenes,
flavones, flavonols and anthocyanins being an estimated 19 (95 % CI 5, 33) %, 69 (95 % CI 13,
125) %, 28 (95 % CI 12, 44) %, 26 (95 % CI 3, 48) %, 50 (95 % CI 28, 72) % and 51 (95 % CI 17,
86) % higher, respectively. Many of these compounds have previously been linked to a reduced
risk of chronic diseases, including CVD and neurodegenerative diseases and certain cancers, in
dietary intervention and epidemiological studies. Additionally, the frequency of occurrence of
pesticide residues was found to be four times higher in conventional crops, which also
contained significantly higher concentrations of the toxic metal Cd. Significant differences
were also detected for some other (e.g. minerals and vitamins) compounds. There is evidence
that higher antioxidant concentrations and lower Cd concentrations are linked to specific
agronomic practices (e.g. non-use of mineral N and P fertilisers, respectively) prescribed in
organic farming systems. In conclusion, organic crops, on average, have higher concentrations
of antioxidants, lower concentrations of Cd and a lower incidence of pesticide residues than
the non-organic comparators across regions and production seasons.

Increased public concerns about the negative environmental and health impacts of agrochemicals
(pesticides, growth regulators and mineral fertilisers) used in crop production have been major
drivers for the increase in consumer demand for organic foods over the last 20 years(

1

–

3

).

Organic crop production standards prohibit the use of synthetic chemical crop protection
products and certain mineral fertilisers (all N, KCl and superphosphate) to reduce environmental
impacts (nitrate () leaching and P run-off and pesticide contamination of groundwater) and the
risk of pesticide residues being present in crop plants(

4

). Instead, they prescribe regular inputs of organic fertilisers (e.g. manure and
composts), use of legume crops in rotation (to increase soil N levels), and application of
preventative and non-chemical crop protection methods (e.g. the use of crop rotation, more
resistant/tolerant varieties, mechanical and flame weeding, and biological disease and pest
control products). However, organic standards permit the use of certain plant or microbial
extract and/or mineral (e.g. Cu- and S-based) crop protection products(

5

,

6

).

As a result, organic and conventional crop production may differ significantly in crop rotation
designs and fertilisation and crop protection protocols as well as in the type of crop varieties
used(

6

–

10

). Apart from minimising the risk of agrochemical residues being present in crops, the
agronomic protocols used in organic farming systems may also affect mineral uptake patterns and
metabolic processes in crop plants. Recent studies have shown that the switch from mineral to
organic fertilisers results in significant differences in gene and protein expression patterns
and, as a result, in secondary metabolite profiles; for example, approximately 10 % of proteins
have been found to be either up- or down-regulated in response to contrasting fertiliser inputs
in potato and wheat(

10

–

15

). Also, a switch from pesticide-based conventional to organic crop protection
protocols has been shown to have a significant, but more limited effect than fertilisation
regimens, and there were some statistically significant interactions between fertilisation and
crop protection protocols with respect to gene and protein expression pattern(

10

–

15

).

Over the last 20 years, a large number of scientific studies have compared the concentrations
of nutritionally relevant minerals (e.g. Fe, Zn, Cu and Se), toxic metals (e.g. Cd and Pb),
pesticide residues, macronutrients (e.g. proteins, fats and carbohydrates) and secondary
metabolites (e.g. antioxidants, (poly)phenolics and vitamins) in crops from organic and
conventional production systems (see the online supplementary material for a list of
publications).

There is particular interest in antioxidant activity/concentrations, as there is strong
scientific evidence for health benefits associated with increased consumption of crops rich in
(poly)phenolics and other plant secondary metabolites with antioxidant activity (e.g. carotenoids
and vitamins C and E)(

16

–

18

). Most importantly, a substantial number of human dietary intervention studies have
reported an increased dietary intake of antioxidant/(poly)phenolic-rich foods to protect against
chronic diseases, including CVD, certain cancers (e.g. prostate cancer) and neurodegenerative
diseases; a detailed description of the evidence has been given in recent reviews by Del Rio
et al.
(

16

) and Wahlqvist(

17

). Also, these plant secondary metabolites are increasingly being recognised to
contribute significantly to the health benefits associated with increased fruit, vegetable and
whole grain consumption(

16

–

18

).

Several systematic literature reviews have recently analysed the available published
information, using both qualitative and quantitative methods, with the aim of identifying the
potential effects of organic and conventional production protocols on the nutritional quality of
crops(

19

–

21

). However, these systematic reviews (1) used different methodologies (e.g. weighted
and unweighted meta-analyses) and inclusion criteria, (2) did not cover most of the large amount
of information published in the last 4–5 years, (3) provided no structured assessment of the
strength of the evidence presented, and (4) came to contrasting conclusions. As a result, there
is still considerable controversy as to whether the use of organic production standards results
in significant and consistent changes in the concentrations of potentially health-promoting (e.g.
antioxidants, (poly)phenolics, vitamins and certain minerals) and potentially harmful (e.g. Cd
and Pb) compounds in crops and crop-based foods(

7

,

19

–

22

). However, there is increasing evidence and more widespread acceptance that the
consumption of organic foods is likely to reduce exposure to pesticide residues(

21

,

23

,

24

).

There are major research synthesis challenges to assessing differences in crop composition
resulting from farming practices. Most importantly, the studies available for meta-analyses (1)
have used different experimental designs (e.g. replicated field experiments, farm surveys and
retail surveys) and (2) have been carried out in countries/regions with contrasting agronomic and
pedo-climatic background conditions (see the online supplementary material for a list of
publications). This heterogeneity is likely to increase the amount of published data required to
detect and understand variation in composition parameters resulting from the use of contrasting
crop production methods. An additional problem is that many studies do not report measures of
variation, which reduces the within-study power of unweighted analyses and the between-study
power of weighted analyses. Weighted meta-analyses are widely regarded as the most appropriate
statistical approach for comparing data sets from studies with variable experimental
designs(

25

,

26

). However, some studies have used unweighted analytical methods(

19

) to avoid the loss of information associated with conducting weighted meta-analyses
on a subset of the available information.

Therefore, the main objectives of the present study were to (1) carry out a systematic
literature review of studies focused on quantifying composition differences between organic and
conventional crops, (2) conduct weighted and unweighted meta-analyses of the published data, (3)
carry out sensitivity analyses focused on identifying to what extent meta-analysis results are
affected by the inclusion criteria (e.g. using mean or individual data reported for different
crop varieties or experimental years) and meta-analysis method (e.g. weighted v.
unweighted), and (4) discuss meta-analysis results in the context of the current knowledge about
the nutritional impacts of compounds for which significant composition differences were detected.

The present study specifically focused on plant secondary metabolites (especially
antioxidants/(poly)phenolics and vitamins), potentially harmful synthetic chemical pesticides,
toxic metals (including Cd, As and Pb), , nitrite (), macronutrients (including proteins, amino acids, carbohydrates and reducing
sugars) and minerals (including all plant macro- and micronutrients). Metabolites produced by
micro-organisms on plants (e.g. mycotoxins) were not the subject of the present systematic
literature review and meta-analyses.

The literature search strategy and meta-analysis protocols used were based on those
previously published by Brandt et al.
(

27

), and flow diagrams of the protocols used are shown in Figs. 1 and ​and2.2. Relevant publications
were identified through an initial search of the literature with Web of Knowledge using the
following search terms: (1) organic* or ecologic* or biodynamic*; (2) conventional* or
integrated; (3) names of ninety-eight relevant crops and foods (see online supplementary Table
S1 for a full list). Publications in all languages, published in peer-reviewed journals, and
reporting data on both desirable and undesirable composition parameters were considered
relevant for inclusion in the meta-analyses. The search was restricted to the period between
January 1992 (the year when legally binding organic farming regulations were first introduced
in the European Union) and December 2011 (the year when the project ended) and provided 17 333
references. An additional 208 publications (published between 1977 and 2011) were found by (1)
studying lists of references or (2) directly contacting the authors of the published papers and
reviews identified in the initial literature search. The abstracts of all publications were
then examined to determine whether they contained original data obtained by comparing
composition parameters in organic and conventional plant foods. This led to the identification
of 448 suitable publications. Of these, 105 papers were subsequently rejected, because reading
of the full papers indicated that they did not report suitable data sets or contained the same
data as other studies.

Data sets were deemed suitable if the mean concentrations of at least one mineral,
macronutrient, secondary metabolite or / or the frequency of occurrence of pesticide residues in organic and
conventional crops or crop-based foods were reported. Only four non-peer-reviewed papers with
suitable data sets were identified but subsequently rejected, as the small number minimised any
potential bias(

28

) from using peer review as a ‘quality’ selection criterion.

As a result, 343 peer-reviewed publications reporting crop composition data were selected for
data extraction, of which 156 references fulfilled the criteria for inclusion in the standard
weighted meta-analysis and 343 fulfilled the criteria for inclusion in the standard unweighted
meta-analysis. This represents a significantly greater evidence base than the three previous
systematic reviews/meta-analyses of comparative crop composition data(

19

–

21

). All publications included in these previous reviews (including studies published
before 1992) were also used in the standard weighted meta-analysis carried out in the present
study, except for a small number of papers that were found to report the same data as other
publications that had already been included.

Data were extracted from three types of comparative studies: (1) comparisons of matched farms
(CF), farm surveys in which samples were collected from organic and conventional farms in the
same country or region; (2) basket studies (BS), retail product surveys in which organic and
conventional products were collected in retail outlets; (3) controlled field experiments (EX)
in which samples were collected from experimental plots managed according to organic or
conventional farming standards/protocols. Data from all the three types of studies were deemed
relevant for the meta-analyses if the authors stated that (1) organic farms included in farm
surveys were using organic farming methods, (2) organic products collected in retail surveys
were labelled as organic, and (3) organic plots used in EX were managed according to organic
farming standards.

Several studies compared more than one organic or conventional system or treatment. For
example, additional conventional systems/treatments were described as ‘integrated,’ ‘low
input,’ ‘low fertility’ or ‘extensive’, and an additional organic system/treatment included in
some studies was described as ‘biodynamic’. Also, in some publications, organic or conventional
systems with contrasting rotation designs (e.g. with or without cover crops) or fertilisation
regimens (different types and levels of N inputs) were compared. In such cases, only the
organic and conventional (non-organic) system identified by the authors as closest to the
typical, contemporary organic/conventional farming system was used in the meta-analyses, as
recommended by Brandt et al.
(

20

). Full references of the publications and a summary of descriptions of the studies
included in the meta-analyses are given in Tables S2 and S4 (available online).

The database generated and used for the meta-analyses will be made freely available on the
Newcastle University website (http://research.ncl.ac.uk/nefg/QOF) for use and scrutiny by
others.

Information and data were extracted from all the selected publications (see above) and
compiled in a Microsoft Access database. A list of the information extracted from the
publications and recorded in the database is given in Table S4 (available online).

Data reported as numerical values in the text or tables were copied directly into the
database. Only data published in graphical form were enlarged, printed, measured (using a
ruler) and then entered into the database as described previously(

20

).

Where data for multiple time points were reported, two approaches were used, depending on
whether the analysed crop tissue was likely to be used as food/feed. For crops that are
continuously harvested (e.g. tomato and cucumber), analytical data for mature/ripe products
(e.g. fruits) collected at multiple time points during the season were averaged before being
used in the standard meta-analyses; if analytical data for immature/unripe products were
reported, they were not included in the mean. For crops (e.g. grape and cereals) in which
products (e.g. fruits and grain) are harvested/analysed at different maturity stages, only
analytical results for the mature product (that would have been used as food/feed) were used.
In both the standard weighted and standard unweighted analyses, composition data reported for
different cultivars/varieties and/or years/growing seasons in the same publication were
averaged before being used in the meta-analyses.

Publications were assessed for eligibility and data were independently extracted from them by
two reviewers. Data extracted by the two reviewers were then compared. Discrepancies were
detected for approximately 2 % of the data extracted, and in these cases, data extraction was
repeated to correct mistakes. A list of the publications included in the meta-analyses is given
in Table S2 (available online).

Study characteristics, summaries of the methods used for sensitivity analyses and ancillary
information are given in Tables S2–S10 (available online). These include information on (1) the
number of papers from different countries and publication years used in the meta-analyses (see
online supplementary Figs. S1 and S2); (2) study type, location and crop/products assessed in
different studies (see online supplementary Table S3); (3) the type of material/data extracted
from the papers (see online supplementary Table S4); (4) data-handling methods/inclusion
criteria and meta-analysis methods used in the sensitivity analyses (see online supplementary
Table S5); (5) composition parameters included in the meta-analyses (see online supplementary
Table S6); and (6) composition parameters for which meta-analyses were not possible
(n< 3; see online supplementary Table S7).

Table S8 (available online) summarises basic statistics on the number of studies, individual
comparisons, organic and conventional sample sizes, and comparisons showing statistically or
numerically higher concentrations in organic or conventional crops for the composition
parameters included in Figs. 3 and ​and4.4. Tables S9 and S10 (available online) summarise the numerical values for
the mean percentage differences (MPD) and 95 % CI calculated using the data included in the
standard unweighted and weighted meta-analyses of composition parameters shown in Figs. 3 and ​and4,

A total of eight different meta-analyses were undertaken. The protocols used for the standard
weighted and unweighted meta-analyses were based on the methodologies described by Palupi
et al.
(

29

) and Brandt et al.
(

20

), respectively. In Fig. 3, the results
obtained using standard random-effects meta-analysis weighted by inverse variance and a common
random-effects variance component and unweighted meta-analysis of difference in means are
shown. In addition, six sensitivity analyses were undertaken. Sensitivity analyses included (1)
using data reported for each cultivar or variety of crops separately and/or (2) treating data
reported for different years in the same publication as separate events in the weighted or
unweighted meta-analyses (see online supplementary Table S5). The results of the sensitivity
analyses are available on the Newcastle University website (http://research.ncl.ac.uk/nefg/QOF).

Effect sizes for all the weighted meta-analyses were based on standardised mean differences
(SMD) as recommended for studies in which data obtained by measuring the same parameters on
different scales are included in meta-analyses(

25

,

26

).

Both weighted and unweighted meta-analyses were carried out using the R statistical
programming environment(

30

). Weighted meta-analyses, with the SMD as the basic response variable, were
conducted using standard methods and the open-source ‘metafor’ statistical package(

31

–

34

). A detailed description of the methods and calculations used is given in the
‘Additional Methods Description’ section in the online supplementary material.

A positive SMD value indicates that the mean concentrations of the observed compound are
greater in the organic food samples, while a negative SMD indicates that the mean
concentrations are higher in the conventional food samples. The statistical significance of a
reported effect size (i.e. SMDtot) and CI were estimated based on standard
methods(

35

) using ‘metafor’(

31

). The influence of potential moderators, such as crop/food type (fruits,
vegetables, cereals, oil seeds and pulses, herbs and spices, and crop-based compound foods),
was additionally tested using mixed-effect models(

36

) and subgroup analyses.

We carried out tests of homogeneity (Q statistics and I
2 statistics) on all the summary effect sizes. Homogeneity was indicated if
I
2 was less than 25 % and the P value for the Q
statistics was greater than 0·010. Funnel plots, Egger tests of funnel plot asymmetry and
fail-safe number tests were used to assess publication bias(

37

) (see online supplementary Table S13 for further information).

For the unweighted meta-analysis, the ratio of organic means:conventional means () expressed as a percentage was ln-transformed, and the values were used to
determine whether the arithmetic average of the ln-transformed ratios was significantly greater
than ln(100), using resampling(

38

). The reported P values were derived from Fisher's one-sample
randomisation test(

39

), and a P< 0·05 was considered statistically significant.
For all composition parameters for which a statistically significant difference between organic
and conventional food samples was detected in the standard weighted analysis (analysis 1),
forest plots were constructed to show SMD and corresponding 95 % CI for individual studies and
types of foods (see Fig. 4 and online supplementary
Figs. S5–S41). In addition, the results of the standard unweighted analyses are shown in Figs. 3 and ​and44.

Table S12 (available online) summarises the results of the standard weighted and unweighted
meta-analyses for all the composition parameters for which no analyses detected significant
differences between organic and conventional products.

MPD were calculated for all parameters for which significant effects were detected by the
standard unweighted and/or weighted meta-analysis protocols. This was done to facilitate value
judgements regarding the biological importance of the relative effect magnitudes. A detailed
description of the calculations is given in the ‘Additional Methods Description’ section in the
online supplementary material.

We also calculated MPD using only data pairs included in the weighted meta-analyses to
estimate the impact of excluding data for which no measures of variance were reported on the
magnitude of difference. As the MPD can be expressed as ‘% higher’ in conventional or organic
crops, they provide estimates for the magnitude of composition differences that are easier to
correlate with existing information on the potential health impacts of changing dietary intake
levels for individual or groups of compounds than the SMD values. The 95 % CI for MPD were
estimated using a standard method(

35

).

For some composition parameters, individual effect sizes were more than fifty times greater
than the pooled effect. This applied to one effect size each for phenolic acids, flavanones,
flavones, flavonols, carbohydrates, DM and ; four effect sizes for carotenoids and xanthophylls; eight effect sizes for
amino acids; and forty-one effect sizes for volatile compounds. Such large differences can be
considered biologically implausible, and these ‘outlier’ data pairs were therefore omitted from
the final standard meta-analyses as shown in Figs. 3 and
​and44 and Tables S10 and S11 (available online).

Data reported for the frequency of occurrence of detectable pesticide residues (percentage of
samples with detectable pesticide residues) in organic and conventional crops were compared
using a weighted meta-analysis protocol based on the ln-transformed OR(

40

). The formula used to calculate OR is given in the ‘Additional Methods Description’
section in the online supplementary material.

An overall assessment of the strength of evidence was made using an adaptation of the GRADE
(Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system(

41

).

Analyses were based on data from publications reporting results from EX (154 papers), CF (116
papers), and BS (fifty-five papers) or results from more than one type of study (EX, CF and/or
BS; eighteen papers) (see online supplementary Table S3).

Approximately 70 % of all the studies included in the meta-analyses were carried out in
Europe, mainly in Italy, Spain, Poland, Sweden, the Czech Republic, Switzerland, Turkey,
Denmark, Finland and Germany, with most of the remaining studies being carried out in the USA,
Brazil, Canada and Japan (see online supplementary Table S3 and Fig. S2). Among the papers
included in the meta-analyses, 174 reported comparison data for vegetables and a smaller number
reported data for fruits and cereals (112 and sixty-one, respectively), while only thirty-seven
reported data for other crops/crop-based food products (e.g. oil seeds and pulses, herbs and
spices, and compound foods) (see online supplementary Table S3). Publications reported data for
907 different composition parameters, of which 182 were included in the meta-analyses (see
online supplementary Tables S6 and S7).

A large number of comparisons were available for antioxidant activity in organic and
conventional crops (160 for the unweighted meta-analysis and sixty-six for the weighted
meta-analysis), but the authors used a wide range of different methodologies. Both weighted and
unweighted meta-analyses detected a significantly higher antioxidant activity in organic crops
(Fig. 3) and the MPD was 17 (95 % CI 3, 32) % (Fig. 3).

When data reported for fruits and vegetables were analysed separately, a significant
difference was detected for fruits, while only a trend towards a significant difference
(P= 0·06) was observed for vegetables (Fig.
4), although there was no evidence of an interaction.

When data available for specific antioxidant activity assays were analysed, similar results
were obtained for the Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity assay with both the standard
weighted and unweighted meta-analyses and for the ferric reducing antioxidant power and oxygen
radical absorbance capacity assays with only the standard unweighted meta-analysis (Fig. 3).

The concentrations of secondary metabolites with antioxidant activity, including a wide range
of nutritionally desirable (poly)phenolics, were also studied in a relatively large number of
studies (see online supplementary Table S8).

For (poly)phenolics, the standard weighted meta-analysis detected significantly and
substantially higher concentrations of total flavonoids, total phenolic acids, phenolic acids
(where data reported for all individual phenolic acid compounds were included in the same
analysis), flavanones, stilbenes, flavones, flavonols, kaempferol, total anthocyanins and
anthocyanins in organic crops and/or processed foods made from organic crops. The unweighted
meta-analysis yielded similar results, except for (1) total flavonoids, for which no
significant difference was detected, and (2) flavanones and flavones, for which only trends
towards higher concentrations in organic crops were detected (Fig. 3). The unweighted meta-analysis also detected significantly higher
concentrations of chlorogenic acid (5-O-caffeoylquinic acid) in organic crops
(Fig. 3). The MPD for most of the compounds were
between 18 and 69 % for most of the above-mentioned antioxidant compounds (Fig. 3). Inclusion of data for which no measures of variance were reported
in the calculation of MPD yielded similar values for phenolic compounds, phenolic acids,
chlorogenic acid, flavones, quercetin, kaempferol and anthocyanins; higher values for phenolic
acids (total), stilbenes and quercetin-3-rutinoside; and lower values for flavonoids,
flavanones and flavonols (see Fig. 4 and online
supplementary Table S9).

When data reported for phenolic compounds, phenolic acids and flavanones in fruits,
vegetables, cereals and/or processed crop-based foods were analysed separately, significant
differences were detected only for the concentrations of phenolic compounds and phenolic acids
in fruits and a trend towards a significant difference (P= 0·09) was detected
for the concentrations of flavanones in fruits (Fig. 4),
although there was no evidence of an interaction. In contrast, when differences in the
concentrations of flavones and flavonols were analysed separately for fruits, vegetables and
cereals, significant differences were detected for vegetables and cereals, but not for fruits,
with evidence of interactions (Fig. 4). For all other
antioxidant/(poly)phenolic compounds, separate analyses for different crop types were not
possible due to the unavailability of sufficient data.

Smaller, but statistically significant and biologically meaningful composition differences
were also detected for a small number of carotenoids and vitamins. Both unweighted and weighted
meta-analyses detected significantly higher concentrations of xanthophylls and
l-ascorbic acid and significantly lower concentrations of vitamin E in organic crops.
Higher concentrations of total carotenoids, carotenoids (where data reported for all individual
phenolic acid compounds were included in the same analysis) and lutein were also detected by
the unweighted meta-analysis (Fig. 3). The MPD were 17
(95 % CI 0, 34) % for total carotenoids, 15 (95 % CI − 3, 32) % for carotenoids (where data
reported for all individual carotenoid compounds were included in the same analysis), 12 (95 %
CI − 4, 28) % for xanthophylls, 5 (95 % CI − 3, 13) % for lutein, 6 (95 % CI − 3, 15) % for
vitamin C and − 15 (95 % CI − 49, 19) % for vitamin E. Inclusion of data for which no measures
of variance were reported in the calculation of MPD resulted in slightly higher values (see
Fig. 4 and online supplementary Table S9).

When data reported for total carotenoids and xanthophylls in fruits, vegetables, cereals and
processed crop-based compound foods were analysed separately, significantly higher
concentrations in organic samples were detected only for fruits (Fig. 4), with evidence of interactions being detected for carotenoids, but
not for xanthophylls.

The meta-analyses did not detect significant differences for a range of other secondary
metabolites with antioxidant activity. These included some individual carotenoids (α-carotene,
lycopene, β-cryptoxanthin and zeaxanthin), vitamins (α-tocopherol, γ-tocopherol, vitamin B and
vitamin B1), some specific phenolic acids (total hydroxycinnamic acids, caffeic
acid, p-coumaric acid, ferulic acid, sinapic acid,
5-O-caffeoylquinic acid, ellagic acid, gallic acid and salicylic acid), some
specific flavones and flavonols (apigenin, luteolin, myricetin 3-O-glucoside,
quercetin 3-O-galactoside, quercetin-3-O-glucoside and
quercetin-3-O-malonyl glucoside) and some specific flavanones (naringenin and
naringenin (R-enantiomer)).

Both unweighted and weighted meta-analyses detected significantly higher concentrations of
total carbohydrates and significantly lower concentrations of proteins, amino acids and fibre
in organic crops/crop-based compound foods (Fig. 3). The
unweighted meta-analysis also detected significantly higher concentrations of reducing sugars
and DM in organic crops (Fig. 4). The MPD were 25 (95 %
CI 5, 45) % for total carbohydrates, 11 (95 % CI 2, 20) % for carbohydrates (where data
reported for all individual phenolic acid compounds were included in the same analysis), 7
(95 % CI 4, 11) % for reducing sugars, − 15 (95 % CI − 27, − 3) % for proteins, − 11 (95 % CI
− 14, − 8) % for amino acids, 2 (95 % CI − 1, 6) % for DM and − 8 (95 % CI − 14, − 2) % for
fibre. Inclusion of data for which no measures of variance were reported in the calculation of
MPD resulted in similar values for carbohydrates, proteins, DM and fibre; higher values for
reducing sugars; and lower values for carbohydrates (total) and amino acids (see Fig. 4 and online supplementary Table S9).

When data reported for proteins and amino acids in vegetables, cereals and/or processed
crop-based foods were analysed separately, significant differences were detected for cereals
and processed crop-based foods, but not for vegetables (Fig.
4), although there was no evidence of an interaction. Also, when data reported for
carbohydrates in vegetables, fruits and cereals were analysed separately, no significant
effects could be detected in their concentrations (Fig.
4).

Both weighted and unweighted meta-analyses detected significantly lower concentrations of the
toxic metal Cd and total N in organic crops, while lower concentrations of  and  in organic crops were detected only by the unweighted meta-analysis (Fig. 3). The MPD were − 48 (95 % CI − 112, 16) % for Cd, − 10
(95 % CI − 15, − 4) % for N, − 30 (95 % CI − 144, 84) % for  and − 87 (95 % CI − 225, 52) % for  (Fig. 3).

Inclusion of data for which no measures of variance were reported in the calculation of MPD
resulted in similar values for N, ,  and Cd (see Fig. 4 and online
supplementary Table S9).

When data reported for N and Cd concentrations in fruits, vegetables and cereals were
analysed separately, significant differences were detected for cereals, but not for vegetables
and/or fruits (Fig. 4), although there was no evidence
of an interaction.

For the toxic metals As and Pb, no significant differences could be detected in their
concentrations between organic and conventional crops in the meta-analyses (see online
supplementary Table S12).

The standard meta-analyses showed that the frequency of occurrence of detectable pesticide
residues was four times higher in conventional crops (46 (95 % CI 38, 55) %) than in organic
crops (11 (95 % CI 7, 14) %) (Fig. 5). Significantly
higher frequencies of occurrence of pesticide residues in conventional crops were also detected
when data reported for fruits, vegetables and processed crop-based foods were analysed
separately (Fig. 5). Conventional fruits had a higher
frequency (75 (95 % CI 65, 85) %) of occurrence of pesticide residues than vegetables (32 (95 %
CI 22, 43) %) and crop-based compound foods (45 (95 % CI 25, 65) %), while contamination rates
were very similar in the different organic crop types. This resulted in significant differences
in the OR for different crop types (Fig. 5).

For most of the minerals (including many plant marco- and micronutrients), the meta-analyses
could not detect significant composition differences between organic and conventional crops
(see online supplementary Table S12). However, for a small number of minerals, differences in
composition were identified by both weighted and unweighted meta-analyses, which detected
significantly lower concentrations of Cr and Sr ( − 59 (95 % CI − 147, 30) % and − 26 (95 % CI
− 45, − 6) %, respectively), but significantly higher concentrations of Mo and Rb (65 (95 % CI
26, 105) % and 82 (95 % CI 6, 157) %, respectively) in organic crops. Also, lower
concentrations of Mn ( − 8 (95 % CI − 13, − 3) %) and higher concentrations of Ga and Mg in
organic crops (57 (95 % CI − 122, 8) % and 4 (95 % CI − 5, 13) %, respectively) were detected
only by the weighted meta-analysis, while slightly higher concentrations of Zn (5 (95 % CI − 6,
15) %) in organic crops were only detected by the unweighted meta-analysis (see online
supplementary Table S11). As differences for Zn and Mg were relatively small and as there is
limited information about potential health impacts associated with changing intake levels of
either mineral (Cr, Ga, Mo, Sr and Mo), more detailed results are provided only in the online
supplementary material.

Heterogeneity was extremely high (I
2>75 %) for most of the composition parameters, with I
2 ranging from 76 % for ascorbic acid to 100 % for carotenoids and DM (Fig. 3). The only exceptions were vitamin E, reducing sugars,
fibre and , for which the small number of studies and/or high within-study variability
limited the ability to distinguish heterogeneity between the effects.

Strong or moderate funnel plot asymmetry consistent with a publication bias was detected for
approximately half of the parameters. However, it is not possible to definitively attribute
discrepancies between large precise studies and small imprecise studies to publication bias,
which remains strongly suspected rather than detected where asymmetry is severe (see Table 1 and online supplementary Table S13).


GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessments, Development and Evaluation) assessment of
the strength of evidence for standard weighted meta-analysis for parameters included in
Fig. 3 (Standardised mean difference values (SMD)
and 95 % confidence intervals)

FRAP, ferric reducing antioxidant potential; ORAC, oxygen radical absorbance capacity;
TEAC, Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity.

When meta-analysis results obtained from different study types (BS, CF and EX) were compared,
similar results were obtained for most of the composition parameters included in Fig. 3 (see online supplementary Figs. S3 and S4). However,
there was considerable variation between results obtained for different crop types, crop
species, and/or studies carried out in countries with contrasting pedo-climatic and agronomic
background conditions (see Fig. 4 and online
supplementary Figs. S5–S41).

Non-weighted MPD were calculated to aid in the biological interpretation of effect size
magnitude where either the weighted or unweighted meta-analysis had identified statistically
significant results. For many parameters, MPD based on all the available data produced values
very similar to those calculated using only data for which measures of variance were reported
( = those used for the weighted meta-analysis; Fig. 3).
However, for other parameters (flavonoids, total phenolic acids, flavanones, rutin,
l-ascorbic acid, reducing sugars and Cd), inclusion criteria had a large effect on the
MPD.

Also, when the calculated MPD were superimposed onto SMD (with 95 % CI) results at an
appropriate scale ( − 100 to +100 for MPD and − 5 to +5 for SMD), a reasonable match was
observed, with MPD for most of the compounds being present within the 95 % CI for SMD (Fig. 3). However, for some parameters (Trolox equivalent
antioxidant capacity, total phenolic acids, stilbenes, rutin, total carotenoids,
l-ascorbic acid, vitamin E, reducing sugars, proteins, ,  and Cd), MPD were outside the 95 % CI of SMD, and therefore these should be
seen as less reliable.

For the composition parameters included in Fig. 3,
sensitivity analyses, which were based on different inclusion criteria and data-handling
methods, yielded results broadly similar to those yielded by the standard weighted and
unweighted meta-analyses.

The overall assessment of the strength of evidence using an adapted GRADE(

41

) approach highlighted uncertainties in the evidence base, but the overall strength
of evidence was moderate or high for the majority of parameters for which significant
differences were detected (see Table 1 and online
supplementary Table S13).

The results of meta-analyses of the extensive data set of 343 peer-reviewed publications
indicated that organic crops and processed crop-based foods have a higher antioxidant activity
and contain higher concentrations of a wide range of nutritionally desirable
antioxidants/(poly)phenolics, but lower concentrations of the potentially harmful, toxic metal
Cd. For plant secondary metabolites, this confirms the results of the meta-analyses carried out
by Brandt et al.
(

20

), which indicated that there are significant composition differences between organic
and conventional crops for a range of nutritionally relevant compounds. However, it contradicts
the results of the systematic reviews/meta-analyses by Dangour et al.
(

19

) and Smith-Spangler et al.
(

21

), which indicated that there are no significant composition differences between
organic and conventional crops. The main reason for the inability of previous studies to detect
composition differences was probably the highly limited number of studies/data sets available or
included in analyses by these authors, which would have decreased the statistical power of the
meta-analyses.

In addition, most of the previous studies did not use weighted meta-analyses based on SMD.
This approach is recommended when combining data from studies that measure the same parameter
(e.g. the major phenolic compounds found in different crops), but use different scales(

25

,

26

,

29

). In the study carried out by Dangour et al.
(

19

), published data from (1) surveys in which the organic samples were produced to
‘biodynamic-organic’ standards and (2) field experiments investigating associations between
organic and conventional production protocols and crop composition were not included in the
meta-analyses. This would have further reduced the number of data sets and sensitivity of
meta-analyses and contributed to the lack of significant composition differences being detected.
In the meta-analyses carried out in the present study, ‘biodynamic-organic’ data sets were
treated as organic, as biodynamic standards comply with the legal European Union organic farming
standards. Data from comparative field experiments were also included, as controlled
experimental studies are less affected by confounding factors (e.g. contrasting soil and
climatic and agronomic background conditions between farms that supplied organic and
conventional samples) than farm and retail surveys. The reason for excluding field experiments
carried out in the study of Dangour et al.
(

19

) is that in the field experiments the organic plots were not certified according to
organic farming standards. In the meta-analyses carried out in the present study, field
experiments investigating associations between organic and conventional agronomic
practices/protocols and crop composition were included, as the crop management practices rather
than the certification process were assumed to affect crop performance and composition.

The finding of a four times higher frequency of occurrence of pesticide residues in
conventional crops confirms the results of the study of Smith-Spangler et al.
(

21

), in which a very similar set of studies (nine of the ten publications used in the
present study) were used for analysis.

The potential (1) nutritional benefits of higher concentrations of antioxidant/(poly)phenolics
in organic crops, (2) risks associated with potentially harmful pesticide residues, Cd,  and , and (3) agronomic factors responsible for composition differences are
discussed in more detail below.

Among the composition differences detected by the meta-analyses carried out in the present
study, the higher antioxidant activity and higher concentrations of a wide range of
antioxidants/(poly)phenolics found in organic crops/crop-based foods may indicate the greatest
potential nutritional benefits. Based on the differences reported, results indicate that a
switch from conventional to organic crop consumption would result in a 20–40 % (and for some
compounds more than 60 %) increase in crop-based antioxidant/(poly)phenolic intake levels
without a simultaneous increase in energy, which would be in line with the dietary
recommendations(

16

,

17

). This estimated magnitude of difference would be equivalent to the amount of
antioxidants/(poly)phenolics present in one to two of the five portions of fruits and
vegetables recommended to be consumed daily and would therefore be significant/meaningful in
terms of human nutrition, if information linking these plant secondary metabolites to the
health benefits associated with increased fruit, vegetable and whole grain consumption is
confirmed(

16

–

18

).

However, it is important to point out that there is still a lack of knowledge about the
potential human health impacts of increasing antioxidant/(poly)phenolic intake levels and
switching to organic food consumption. For example, there are still gaps in the understanding
of the (1) uptake, bioavailability and metabolism of (poly)phenolics after ingestion and (2)
exact compounds/molecules and modes of action responsible for health benefits(

16

). Also, it is important to consider that most of the human dietary intervention
studies on associations between antioxidant/(poly)phenolic intake and health indicators were
based on the comparison of standard diets with diets in which the amount of specific
(poly)phenolic-rich foods (e.g. cocoa, red wine, tea/coffee, berries, citrus and nuts) was
high(

16

,

17

).

There are, to our knowledge, only two human dietary intervention studies in which contrasting
antioxidant/(poly)phenolic intake levels were generated by providing diets based on
conventional and organic crops; both studies focused on assessing antioxidant status in humans
and were inconclusive with respect to the identification of potential health impacts of organic
food consumption(

21

,

42

,

43

). However, there are several animal dietary intervention studies that have
identified significant associations between organic feed consumption and animal growth and
physiological (including immune and endocrine) parameters and/or biomarkers of health when
compared with conventional feed consumption(

44

,

45

). Among these studies, one recent factorial animal study has gone one step further
and assessed associations between contrasting crop fertilisation and crop protection protocols
used in conventional and organic farming systems and (1) the composition (including
(poly)phenolic content) of crops/compound feeds made from crops and (2) the growth,
physiological, immunological and hormonal parameters of rats that consumed these feeds(

46

). With respect to composition differences, the study yielded results similar to
those of the meta-analyses carried out in the present study. For example, rat feeds produced
from organic crops had lower concentrations of proteins and Cd, but higher concentrations of
polyphenols and the carotenoid lutein. The study also demonstrated that composition differences
were mainly linked to contrasting fertilisation regimens (green and animal manures
v. mineral fertiliser inputs). The consumption of feeds made from organic
crops by the rats resulted in higher levels of body protein, body ash, leucocyte count, plasma
glucose, leptin, insulin-like growth factor 1, corticosterone, and IgM, and spontaneous
lymphocyte proliferation, but lower levels of plasma IgG, testosterone and mitogen-stimulated
proliferation of lymphocytes(

46

). Redundancy analysis identified total polyphenol concentrations in feeds as the
strongest driver for the physiological/endocrinological parameters assessed in rats. This
suggests that a switch from conventional to organic crop consumption may have impacts similar
to those of an increase in the intake of foods with high antioxidant/(poly)phenolic contents.
This hypothesis would merit further exploration in animal and human dietary intervention
studies.

Many of the antioxidants, including (poly)phenolics, found in higher concentrations in
organic crops are known to be produced by plants in response to abiotic (e.g. wounding and
heat, water and nutrient stress) and biotic (pest attacks and disease) stress and form part of
the plants' constitutive and inducible resistance mechanisms to pests and diseases(

47

–

49

). Therefore, higher concentrations of (poly)phenolics in organic crops may be due
to higher incidence/severity of pest and disease damage, causing enhanced (poly)phenolic
production as part of the inducible plant resistance response. The differences in antioxidant
concentrations between organic and conventional crops may therefore have been due to
contrasting pest and disease damage and/or fertilisation intensity. However, there are, to our
knowledge, no sound published data/evidence for a causal link between higher pest/disease
incidence/severity and antioxidant/(poly)phenolic concentrations in organic crops. In contrast,
there is increasing evidence that differences in fertilisation regimens between organic and
conventional production systems (and, in particular, the non-use of high mineral N fertiliser
inputs) are significant drivers for higher (poly)phenolic concentrations in organic crops(

20

,

49

–

52

). For example, Sander & Heitefuss(

50

) reported that increasing mineral N fertilisation resulted in reduced
concentrations of phenolic resistance compounds in wheat leaves and increased severity of
foliar disease (powdery mildew). Similarly, a review by Rühmann et al.
(

51

) describes the negative correlations between N fertilisation/supply-driven shoot
growth and concentrations of phenylpropanoids and apple scab resistance in young leaves in
apple trees(

51

). In tomato, deficiency of both N and P was found to be linked to flavonol
accumulation in plant tissues(

52

). More recently, Almuayrifi(

49

) has demonstrated that the non-use of synthetic pesticides and fungicides has no
effect on phenolic acid and flavonoid concentrations and profiles in wheat, but that the use of
standard, conventional mineral (NPK) fertiliser regimens is associated with significantly lower
phenolic acid and flavonoid concentrations in wheat leaves compared with organic wheat crops
fertilised with green and animal manures only. The variability in relative differences in
antioxidant/(poly)phenolic concentrations found between studies and crops may therefore at
least partially be explained by variability in the fertilisation protocols in both the organic
and non-organic systems compared. The finding in the present study that organic crops have
significantly lower N,  and  concentrations would support the theory that differences in
antioxidant/(poly)phenolic concentrations between organic and conventional crops are driven by
contrasting N supply patterns. This view is supported by previous studies that have suggested
that under high N availability, plants allocate carbohydrates from photosynthesis to primary
metabolism and rapid growth while producing less amounts of secondary metabolites involved in
defence(

51

).

However, additional research is required to gain a more detailed understanding of the
relative contribution of fertilisation and crop protection regimens and disease and pest
prevalence/severity to the expression of constitutive and inducible resistance mechanisms in
different organically managed crop plants(

50

).

Cd is a highly toxic metal and one of the only three toxic metal contaminants (the other two
being Pb and Hg) for which the European Commission has set maximum residue levels (MRL) in
foods(

53

). Cd accumulates in the human body (especially in the liver and kidneys) and
therefore dietary Cd intake levels should be kept as low as possible(

53

). The on average 48 % lower Cd concentrations found in organic crops/crop-based
foods in the meta-analyses carried out in the present study are therefore desirable, although
the exact health benefits associated with reducing Cd intake levels via a switch to organic
food consumption are difficult to estimate. Similar to the results of the present study, a
recent literature review by Smith-Spangler et al.
(

21

) has also reported that of the seventy-seven comparative data sets (extracted from
fifteen publications), twenty-one indicated significantly lower and only one significantly
higher Cd concentrations in organic foods. Differences in Cd contamination levels between
organic and conventional winter wheat have recently been shown to be mainly linked to
differences in fertilisation regimens (especially the high mineral P inputs used in
conventional farming systems), although contrasting rotation designs also contributed to
differences in Cd concentrations between organic and conventional wheat(

7

). A range of other soil (e.g. pH) and agronomic (e.g. liming) factors are known to
affect Cd concentrations in crops(

54

), and these may explain the variability in results between individual comparative
studies, crop species and crop types (see Fig. 4 and
online supplementary Figs. S4 and S22).

The present study demonstrated that the prohibition of synthetic chemical pesticide use under
organic farming standards results in a more than 4-fold reduction in the number of crop samples
with detectable pesticide residues. This supports previous studies that have concluded that
organic food consumption can reduce exposure to pesticide residues(

21

–

23

). The considerably higher frequency of occurrence of detectable residues in
conventional fruits (75 %) than in vegetables (32 %) may indicate higher levels of crop
protection inputs being used in fruit crops, but could also have been due to the use of more
persistent chemicals, different sprayer technologies used and/or pesticide applications being
made closer to harvest. The finding of detectable pesticide residues in a proportion (about
11 %) of organic crop samples may have been due to cross-contamination from neighbouring
conventional fields, the continued presence of very persistent pesticides (e.g. organochlorine
compounds) in fields or perennial crop tissues from past conventional management, and/or
accidental or fraudulent use of prohibited pesticides in organic farms.

Pesticide residues that are below the MRL set by the European Commission(

55

,

56

) are considered by regulators not to pose risk to consumers or the environment, as
they are significantly lower than concentrations for which negative health or environmental
impacts can be detected in the regulatory pesticide safety testing carried out as part of the
pesticide approval process(

55

). However, a significant number of crop samples included in the regulatory European
Food Safety Authority pesticide residue monitoring in Europe are still found to contain
pesticide residues above the MRL(

57

). For example, in recent European Food Safety Authority surveys, pesticide residues
above the MRL have been found in 6·2 % of spinach, 3·8 % of oat, 3·4 % of peach, 3·0 % of
orange, 2·9 % of strawberry and lettuce, 2·8 % of table grape and 2·7 % of apple samples
analysed(

57

). There is still scientific controversy about the safety of some currently
permitted pesticides (e.g. organophosphorus compounds) even at levels below the MRL and complex
mixtures of pesticides, as additive/synergistic effects of pesticide mixtures have been
documented and safety testing of pesticide mixtures is currently not required as part of the
regulatory pesticide approval process(

58

–

60

). Similar to Cd, the lower risk of exposure to pesticide residues can be considered
desirable, but potential health benefits associated with reducing pesticide exposure via a
switch to organic food consumption are impossible to estimate.

It should be pointed out that (1) there are only eleven studies in which the frequencies of
occurrence of pesticide residues were compared, (2) eight of these studies focused on only one
crop species, (3) no comparative studies for cereals, oilseeds and pulses were identified in
the literature review, and (4) the data available did not allow scientifically robust
comparisons of the concentrations of pesticides. Therefore, it is important to carry out
further studies to improve our understanding of differences in the frequency of occurrence and
concentrations of pesticide residues between organic and conventional crops.

The concentrations of proteins, amino acids and N (which are known to be positively
correlated in plants) were found to be lower in organic crops, and this is consistent with the
results of previous studies that have linked lower protein concentrations to lower N inputs and
N availability in organic crop production systems(

61

,

62

). The nutritional significance/relevance of slightly lower protein and amino acid
concentrations in organic crops to human health is likely to be low, as European and North
American diets typically provide sufficient or even excessive amounts of proteins and essential
amino acids. Also, while some studies concluded that protein content in most European and North
American diets is too high and that this contributes to the increasing incidence of diabetes
and obesity(

63

), other studies reported that increasing protein intake levels may be a strategy to
prevent obesity(

64

). Therefore, the lower protein and amino acid concentrations found in organic foods
are unlikely to have a significant nutritional or health impact.

The higher  and  concentrations in conventional crops are also thought to be linked to high
mineral N inputs, as both  and  are known to accumulate in plants under high-mineral N input regimens(

65

). The higher  concentrations in conventional crops/crop-based foods are nutritionally
undesirable, as they have been described to be risk factors for stomach cancer and
methaemoglobinaemia in humans(

65

). However, while increasing dietary  intake levels is widely considered to be potentially harmful for human
health, there is still controversy about the potential health impacts of crop-based dietary  intake(

65

–

67

).

One of the main challenges to interpreting comparisons of organic and inorganic food
production systems is the high heterogeneity arising from combinations of (1) crops, crop types
and/or crop-based foods, (2) countries, and/or (3) pedo-climatic and agronomic background
conditions. As has been mentioned in previous reviews(

19

–

21

), pooling diverse information was necessary, because for most of the composition
parameters, the number of published studies available was not sufficient to carry out separate
meta-analyses for specific countries/regions and crop types and species. Consequently,
heterogeneity was extremely high (I
2>75 %) for most of the composition parameters for which significant
differences were detected.

For many composition parameters, the method of synthesis did not have large effects on
results, in terms of both statistical significance and the magnitude of relative difference
between organic and conventional crops. This indicates that there is now a sufficiently large
body of published information to identify differences that are relatively consistent across
study types, crops, and pedo-climatic and agronomic environments. Therefore, for these
parameters, future studies should focus on increasing our understanding of the underlying
agronomic, pedo-climatic and crop genetic factors responsible for composition differences
between organic and conventional crops.

For other composition parameters (e.g. ferric reducing antioxidant power, oxygen radical
absorbance capacity, Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity, and levels of flavonoids,
stilbenes, total carotenoids, l-ascorbic acid, proteins,  and Cd), differences in methods had a large impact in terms of both
significant effects being detected and/or estimates of the magnitude of difference based on MPD
and SMD. For these compounds, additional high-quality studies (that report measures of
variance) are required to increase the power of weighted meta-analyses.

Overall assessment of the strength of evidence for antioxidant/(poly)phenolic parameters
indicated high or moderate reliability for thirteen of the nineteen parameters and moderate
reliability for Cd. This supports the conclusion that future research would likely be
confirmatory.

In contrast to previous literature reviews(

19

–

21

), the larger number of studies now available allowed separate meta-analyses to be
carried out for different crop types (e.g. fruits, vegetables and cereals), but only for a
limited number of composition parameters. This demonstrates that there is variation between
crop types with respect to (1) whether the production system has a significant effect and/or
(2) the magnitude of difference between organic and conventional crops, although sample sizes
remain insufficient to detect interactions between crop types in many cases.

The present study also identified variation between studies (1) carried out in countries with
different pedo-climatic conditions and agronomic protocols (e.g. rotation designs, irrigated or
non-irrigated crop production, and level and type of animal manures used) and/or (2) focused on
different crop species. This is not surprising as both genetic and environmental/agronomic
factors are known to affect the concentrations of N, , , proteins, sugars, antioxidants/(poly)phenolics, Cd and pesticides in
crops(

7

,

9

–

12

,

20

,

47

–

52

,

62

). However, due to the lack of detailed information on agronomic and pedo-climatic
background conditions in most of the available literature, it is currently not possible to
quantify the relative contribution of genetic and environmental/agronomic sources of variation.

The unweighted MPD were calculated to provide an estimate of the magnitude of difference that
is meaningful when considering nutritional/health impacts of changes in crop composition.
However, care should be taken when interpreting MPD values, as they do not take variability in
the precision of individual studies into account(

25

) and provide less precise estimates of effect than weighted estimates.

However, there is now evidence from a large number of quality studies that consistently show
that organic production systems result in crops/crop-based compound foods with higher
concentrations of antioxidants/(poly)phenolics and lower concentrations of Cd and pesticide
residues compared with conventional production systems. There is little uncertainty surrounding
this overall result, but further research is required to quantify more accurately the relative
impacts of (1) crop types, species, and varieties/cultivars/hybrids and (2) agronomic and
pedo-climatic background conditions on the relative difference between organic and conventional
crop composition.

The present study identified deficiencies in a large proportion of the published studies.
These included a lack of standardised measurements and a lack of reporting (and, in particular,
the non-reporting of measures of variability and/or replication) for many composition
parameters, and there was evidence of duplicate or selective reporting of data collected in
experiments, which may lead to publication bias. Particularly, there is a lack of studies
comparing pesticide residue levels in organic and conventional crops, and there has been very
little effort taken to re-analyse and then publish available comparative data from food
surveillance surveys (e.g. the regular pesticide residue and food composition surveys carried
out by the European Food Safety Authority and national agencies in Europe and elsewhere). Also,
in many studies, there was a lack of detailed information on (1) the geographical origin of
samples in retail surveys and (2) agronomic (e.g. rotation, fertilisation, tillage and
irrigation regimens), pedo-climatic and crop genetic backgrounds (in farm surveys and field
experiments), which would allow potential sources of variation to be investigated.

Not all studies included in the meta-analyses used certified reference materials as a quality
assurance measure for the accuracy of estimates of concentrations of compounds in crops. This
is unlikely to have affected the estimates of relative differences between organic and
conventional crops, as the same extraction and analytical methods were used for organic and
conventional samples in all the studies included in the meta-analyses in the present study.
However, data from studies that did not use reference materials are less reliable when used to
estimate the concentrations of nutritionally relevant compounds in crops and total dietary
intake levels of such compounds in crop-based foods.

Therefore, it is important to develop guidelines for studies comparing the impacts of
agronomic practices on crop/food composition to minimise heterogeneity and/or allow agronomic,
environmental and crop genetic drivers to be used as covariates in analyses.

A recent review by Smith-Spangler et al.
(

21

) has analysed the results of fourteen studies in which the effects of organic and
conventional food (both crop and livestock product) consumption on clinical outcomes (e.g.
allergic symptoms and Campylobacter infections) and health markers (e.g. serum
lipid and vitamin concentrations) were studied. However, they concluded that the currently
available data do not allow clear trends with respect to health markers and outcomes to be
identified. Therefore, there is an urgent need for well-controlled human intervention and/or
cohort studies to identify/quantify potential human health impacts of organic
v. conventional food consumption.

Diet composition may have an effect on the relative impact of switching from conventional to
organic food consumption, and this should be considered in the design of such studies. For
example, the relative impact of switching from conventional to organic food consumption could
be expected to be smaller for diets with high amounts of (poly)phenolic-rich foods.
