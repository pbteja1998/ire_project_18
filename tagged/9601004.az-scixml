<HEADER ID='H-1'> Related Work on Measuring Similarity </HEADER>
<P>
<S ID='S-20' AZ='BKG'> Words in a language are organized by two kinds of relationship . </S>
<S ID='S-21' AZ='BKG'> One is a syntagmatic relation : how the words are arranged in sequential texts . </S>
<S ID='S-22' AZ='BKG'> The other is a paradigmatic relation : how the words are associated with each other . </S>
<S ID='S-23' AZ='BKG'> Similarity between words can be defined by either a syntagmatic or a paradigmatic relation . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-24' AZ='OTH'> Syntagmatic similarity is based on co-occurrence data extracted from corpora <REF TYPE='P'>Church and Hanks 1990</REF> , definitions in dictionaries <REF TYPE='P'>Wilks et al. 1989</REF> , and so on . </S>
<S ID='S-25' AZ='OTH'> Paradigmatic similarity is based on association data extracted from thesauri <REF TYPE='P'>Morris and Hirst 1991</REF> , psychological experiments <REF TYPE='P'>Osgood 1952</REF> , and so on . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-26' AZ='OWN'> This paper concentrates on paradigmatic similarity , because a paradigmatic relation can be established both inside a sentence and across sentence boundaries , while syntagmatic relations can be seen mainly inside a sentence -- like syntax deals with sentence structure . </S>
<S ID='S-27' AZ='TXT'> The rest of this section focuses on two related works on measuring paradigmatic similarity -- a psycholinguistic approach and a thesaurus-based approach . </S>
</P>
<DIV DEPTH='2'>
<HEADER ID='H-2'> A Psycholinguistic Approach </HEADER>
<P>
<S ID='S-28' AZ='OTH'> Psycholinguists have been proposed methods for measuring similarity . </S>
<S ID='S-29' AZ='OTH'> One of the pioneering works is ` semantic differential ' <REF TYPE='P'>Osgood 1952</REF> which analyses meaning of words into a range of different dimensions with the opposed adjectives at both ends ( see Figure <CREF/> ) , and locates the words in the semantic space . </S>
<IMAGE ID='I-1'/>
<IMAGE ID='I-2'/>
<IMAGE ID='I-3'/>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-30' AZ='OTH'> Recent works on knowledge representation are somewhat related to <REFAUTHOR>Osgood</REFAUTHOR> 's semantic differential . </S>
<S ID='S-31' AZ='OTH'> Most of them describe meaning of words using special symbols like microfeatures <REF TYPE='P'>Waltz and Pollack 1985</REF> , <REF TYPE='P'>Hendler 1989</REF> that correspond to the semantic dimensions . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-32' AZ='CTR'> However , the following problems arise from the semantic differential procedure as measurement of meaning . </S>
<S ID='S-33' AZ='CTR'> The procedure is not based on the denotative meaning of a word , but only on the connotative emotions attached to the word ; it is difficult to choose the relevant dimensions , i.e. the dimensions required for the sufficient semantic space . </S>
</P>
</DIV>
<DIV DEPTH='2'>
<HEADER ID='H-3'> A Thesaurus-based Approach </HEADER>
<P>
<S ID='S-34' AZ='OTH'> <REF TYPE='A'>Morris and Hirst 1991</REF> used <REFAUTHOR>Roget</REFAUTHOR> 's thesaurus as knowledge base for determining whether or not two words are semantically related . </S>
<S ID='S-35' AZ='OTH'> For example , the semantic relation of truck / car and drive / car are captured in the following way : </S>
<IMAGE ID='I-4'/>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-36' AZ='OTH'> This method can capture almost all types of semantic relations ( except emotional and situational relation ) , such as paraphrasing by superordinate ( ex . cat / pet ) , systematic relation ( ex .  north / east ) , and non-systematic relation ( ex .  theatre / film ) . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-37' AZ='CTR'> However , thesauri provide neither information about semantic difference between words juxtaposed in a category , nor about strength of the semantic relation between words -- both are to be dealt in this paper . </S>
<S ID='S-38' AZ='BKG'> The reason is that thesauri are designed to help writers find relevant words , not to provide the meaning of words . </S>

<HEADER ID='H-18'> Conclusion </HEADER>
<P>
<S ID='S-163' AZ='AIM'> We described measurement of semantic similarity between words . </S>
<S ID='S-164' ABSTRACTC='A-1' AZ='OWN'> The similarity between words is computed by spreading activation on the semantic network Paradigme which is systematically constructed from a subset of the English dictionary LDOCE . </S>
<S ID='S-165' ABSTRACTC='A-2' AZ='OWN'> Paradigme can directly compute the similarity between any two words in LDV , and indirectly the similarity of all the other words in LDOCE . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-166' ABSTRACTC='A-0' AZ='OWN'> The similarity between words provides a new method for analysing the structure of text . </S>
<S ID='S-167' AZ='OWN'> It can be applied to computing the similarity between texts , and measuring the cohesiveness of a text which suggests coherence of the text , as we have seen in Section <CREF/> . </S>
<S ID='S-168' AZ='OWN'> And , we are now applying it to text segmentation <REF TYPE='P'>Grosz and Sidner 1986</REF> , <REF TYPE='P'>Youmans 1991</REF> , i.e. to capture the shifts of coherent scenes in a story . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-169' AZ='OWN'> In future research , we intend to deal with syntagmatic relations between words . </S>
<S ID='S-170' AZ='OWN'> Meaning of a text lies in the texture of paradigmatic and syntagmatic relations between words <REF TYPE='P'>Hjelmslev 1943</REF> . </S>
<S ID='S-171' AZ='OWN'> Paradigme provides the former dimension -- an associative system of words -- as a screen onto which the meaning of a word is projected like a still picture . </S>
<S ID='S-172' AZ='OWN'> The latter dimension -- syntactic process -- will be treated as a film projected dynamically onto Paradigme . </S>
<S ID='S-173' AZ='OWN'> This enables us to measure the similarity between texts as a syntactic process , not as word lists . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-174' AZ='OWN'> We regard Paradigme as a field for the interaction between text and episodes in memory -- the interaction between what one is hearing or reading and what one knows <REF TYPE='P'>Schank 1990</REF> . </S>
<S ID='S-175' AZ='OWN'> The meaning of words , sentences , or even texts can be projected in a uniform way on Paradigme , as we have seen in Section <CREF/> and <CREF/> . </S>
<S ID='S-176' AZ='OWN'> Similarly , we can project text and episodes , and recall the most relevant episode for interpretation of the text . </S>
