Predicting the diagnosis of autism in adults using the Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ) questionnaire.

Abstract

Many adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) remain undiagnosed. Specialist
assessment clinics enable the detection of these cases, but such services are often
overstretched. It has been proposed that unnecessary referrals to these services could
be reduced by prioritizing individuals who score highly on the Autism-Spectrum Quotient
(AQ), a self-report questionnaire measure of autistic traits. However, the ability of
the AQ to predict who will go on to receive a diagnosis of ASD in adults is unclear.

We studied 476 adults, seen consecutively at a national ASD diagnostic referral service
for suspected ASD. We tested AQ scores as predictors of ASD diagnosis made by expert
clinicians according to International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 criteria,
informed by the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-Generic (ADOS-G) and Autism
Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) assessments.

Of the participants, 73% received a clinical diagnosis of ASD. Self-report AQ scores
did not significantly predict receipt of a diagnosis. While AQ scores provided high
sensitivity of 0.77 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72–0.82] and positive predictive
value of 0.76 (95% CI 0.70–0.80), the specificity of 0.29 (95% CI 0.20–0.38) and
negative predictive value of 0.36 (95% CI 0.22–0.40) were low. Thus, 64% of those who
scored below the AQ cut-off were ‘false negatives’ who did in fact have ASD.
Co-morbidity data revealed that generalized anxiety disorder may ‘mimic’ ASD and inflate
AQ scores, leading to false positives.

The AQ's utility for screening referrals was limited in this sample. Recommendations
supporting the AQ's role in the assessment of adult ASD, e.g. UK NICE guidelines, may
need to be reconsidered.

Introduction

Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a family of lifelong neurodevelopmental syndromes with
a prevalence of at least 1% (Baird et al.
2006; Baron-Cohen et al.
2009; Brugha et al.
2011a; Developmental Disabilities
Monitoring Network Surveillance Year 2010 Principal
Investigators, 2014). In the UK, it is estimated that each case of ASD is associated with
average total lifetime costs of nearly £1 million (Buescher et al.
2014). Early and accurate diagnosis of ASD is
crucial to enable affected individuals to receive treatment and support (Koegel et
al.
2014). Nonetheless, ASD frequently goes undiagnosed
into adulthood, which causes avoidable distress and morbidity (Geurts & Jansen,
2012; Nylander et al.
2013). Indeed, undiagnosed ASD is increasingly
recognized as a significant problem in general adult psychiatry, and as an important
differential diagnosis in this setting (Tebartz van Elst et al.
2013). Diagnosis of previously undetected ASD in
adults is therefore key to managing the disorder, yet as there are no reliable biomarkers
for ASD (Horder & Murphy, 2012), diagnosis
relies on lengthy and costly expert clinical assessments. The capacity of adult ASD
diagnostic services is, therefore, stretched.

In light of the fact that resource limitations can delay or prevent individuals from
receiving a needed ASD assessment, it has been proposed that a means to ‘gate’ or triage
referrals to such services is desirable. In particular, the Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ), a
self-report questionnaire (Baron-Cohen et al.
2001), has been suggested as a means of quickly and
cost-effectively estimating ASD risk and thus guiding referrals. The UK National Institute
for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recently endorsed the AQ for this purpose
(Woodbury-Smith et al.
2005; NICE, 2012). NICE recommends that individuals with ‘possible autism’ should be offered a
referral to a specialist diagnostic service if they score above the threshold (6 or more out
of 10) on the AQ questionnaire.

However, it is not clear how well the AQ is suitable for the role of referral screening.
While the AQ has been shown to discriminate well between individuals with diagnosed ASD and
healthy controls (Baron-Cohen et al.
2001; Wakabayashi et al.
2006; Booth et al.
2013), little is known about whether the AQ can
predict ASD diagnosis in adults with suspected ASD. One previous study (Ketelaars et
al.
2008) found that the AQ was unable to predict ASD
diagnosis within a clinically suspected population, although the sample size was small (21
ASD cases). Two other groups have reported that the AQ's performance in predicting ASD
diagnosis was excellent (Woodbury-Smith et al.
2005) or fair (Sizoo et al.
2015). Yet no study to date has examined whether
other psychiatric disorders (co-morbidities), such as anxiety or depression, act as
confounds in the relationship between AQ scores and ASD diagnosis. This is a limitation,
since co-morbidities are common in patients presenting for a diagnostic evaluation. Nor is
it known whether the AQ predicts scores on the so-called ‘gold-standard’ (Baird et
al.
2006) formal diagnostic assessments for ASD, the
Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-Generic (ADOS-G) or the Autism Diagnostic
Interview-Revised (ADI-R).

Therefore, we conducted the present study in order to, for the first time, examine the
performance of the AQ questionnaire as a predictor of the outcome of an expert clinical ASD
assessment, and the ADOS and ADI, in adults referred to a specialist diagnostic service with
possible ASD, who were also assessed for co-morbidities. We studied a large sample of
patients seen at a specialist diagnostic referral service. We examined the 10-item AQ10
version of the questionnaire (Booth et al.
2013), which is recommended in the NICE guidelines,
and also the original 50-item version of the scale (AQ50). Our objective was to test the
suitability of the AQ for ASD screening in the context prescribed by NICE.

Recruitment

This study included 476 patients seen at the Behavioural Genetics Clinic (BGC) at the
Maudsley Hospital in London, England. The BGC is a National Specialist Centre that accepts
referrals from across the UK. The BGC offers a comprehensive psychiatric assessment;
however, the focus is on the diagnosis of ASD, and the BGC only accepts referrals where
the primary suspected diagnosis is ASD. The present sample represents all of the patients
seen (consecutive admissions) at the BGC clinic over the period from September 2009 to May
2013. This is because, in September 2009 the BGC clinic added the AQ to the clinical
questionnaire pack sent to all patients before their assessment, and in May 2013 the
decision was taken to begin the current analysis of the AQ data. The only selection
criteria were age 18+ years and giving informed consent. Over the period of this study,
primary care (general practitioners) accounted for 37.7% of the referrals to the BGC,
tertiary care 52.9%, and other sources 9.3%.
Screening measures (AQ questionnaire)

Screening measures included the brief AQ10 questionnaire, and the full-length AQ50.
Participants completed the AQ50, and we derived AQ10 scores from these answers, according
to Allison et al. (2012). AQ10
scores are calculated by summing the following 10 items from the AQ50 questionnaire: items
5, 20, 27, 28, 31, 32, 36, 37, 41 and 45. These items were selected by Allison et
al. (2012) on the basis that they best
discriminated (i.e. have the highest discrimination index) between ASD patients and
healthy controls. The original Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ50) contains 50 questions,
relating to social skill, attention switching, attention to detail, communication and
imagination. Each item has four possible responses (‘definitely agree’, ‘slightly agree’,
‘slightly disagree’, ‘definitely disagree’). Respondents are instructed to select one
response per item. Items are scored dichotomously (i.e. collapsing ‘definitely agree’ and
‘slightly agree’ into ‘agree’ and similarly for ‘disagree’), with one point being assigned
for each response characteristic of ASD. Total AQ50 scores therefore range from 0 to 50,
with higher scores indicating more autistic traits. The published cut-off value for the
AQ10 is ⩾6, i.e. scores of 6 or above are considered positive for ASD (Allison et
al.
2012). For the AQ50, we compared two previously
described cut-offs: the ‘clinical’ threshold of ⩾32 and the ‘screening’ cut-off of ⩾26
(Baron-Cohen et al.
2001). All questionnaires were administered in
English.

Additionally, we investigated a novel variant of the AQ modified as an informant-rated
scale. This measure, which has not been previously validated, was introduced in the BGC
clinic to explore its potential as a non-self report measure of ASD symptoms and
difficulties. A family member or close friend of the participant completed the informant
AQ50. All of the questions were taken from the original AQ but re-worded to the
gender-neutral third person. For example, AQ50 item 1: ‘I prefer to do things with others
rather than on my own’ was changed to ‘S/he prefers to do things with others rather than
on his/her own’. The informant AQ10 was derived in the same way as the self-report
version. All questionnaires were administered in English.
ASD assessment

Two formal ASD assessments are used in the BGC service: the ADOS-G (Lord et al.
2000) and the ADI-R (Lord et al.
1994). Experienced clinicians or clinical
research workers administered these assessments. A clinical expert judgement (diagnosis)
was made.

The ADOS-G is a measure of current ASD symptoms. The assessment comprises a structured
activity session and semi-structured interview that includes a series of social presses
and other opportunities intended to elicit behaviours associated with ASD. ADOS-G module
4, designed for verbally fluent adolescents and adults, was used.

The ADI-R is a parent/primary caregiver interview focused on developmental history of
ASD-specific behaviours. The ADI-R is a measure of early-life symptoms. Scores are
aggregated into symptom clusters that correspond to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV) criteria for a diagnosis of autism (Lord et
al.
1994).

Clinical diagnosis was made in a diagnostic meeting by consensus amongst a
multidisciplinary team, including consultant psychiatrists, psychologists, psychiatry
senior house officers (residents), specialist nurses and clinical research workers, using
International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 research criteria and informed by the
patient's ADOS-G and ADI-R scores. For this study, any autism-spectrum diagnosis was
considered ‘ASD’, including diagnoses of autism and Asperger's syndrome.

Reflecting clinical practice at the BGC service, the ADI-R was always performed first if
possible (i.e. if the parent or caregiver was alive and willing to be interviewed, and the
patient provided consent for us to speak with them). If the ADI-R could not be performed,
or if the outcome of the ADI-R was unclear, the ADOS-G was completed. Therefore some
patients received an ADI-R only, some received an ADOS-G only, and a minority received
both an ADI-R and an ADOS-G (these patients represented the more complex cases.)
Sample size

A total of 476 adult patients were seen at the BGC clinic during the period of the study.
Self-rated AQ50 scores were available for 456 of these (96%) and AQ10 scores were
subsequently calculated for 428 (90%) (see online Supplementary Method). Of the patients,
473 (99%) received a clinical consensus expert diagnosis, 210 (44%) received an ADOS-G
assessment, 305 (64%) received an ADI-R, of which 40 received both ADOS-G and ADI-R. No
a priori sample size calculation was performed because these data were
originally collected for clinical purposes.

All procedures contributing to this work comply with the ethical standards of the
relevant UK and institutional guidelines and with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as
revised in 2008. All participants provided written consent to use outcome measures and
clinical data for research purposes, and the study was approved by the National Research
Ethics Service (NRES) Ethics Committee London – South East (ref: 12/LO/0790).

years or younger. Of the patients, 346 (73%) were assigned a diagnosis of ASD by the
clinical team at the BGC (see Table 1).

The AQ10 as a predictor of ASD diagnosis

The AQ10, with a cut-off of ⩾6, did not predict ASD diagnosis better than chance
[χ2 = 1.423, degrees of freedom (df) = 1, p = 0.233]. While
the test showed high sensitivity (0.77) as a predictor of receiving an ASD diagnosis, its
specificity was less good (0.29) (see Table 2).
The positive predictive value was high (0.76), indicating that three-quarters of those
scoring ⩾6 on the AQ10 did receive a clinical diagnosis of ASD. However, the low negative
predictive value (0.36) implies that nearly two-thirds of those who scored below the ⩾6
AQ10 cut-off, predicted not to receive an ASD diagnosis, in fact were diagnosed with ASD.

Diagnostic accuracy of the self-report and the informant-report AQ10 and AQ50

AQ10, 10-Item Autism-Spectrum Quotient; AQ50, 50-item AQ; CI, confidence
interval; PPV, positive predictive value; NPV, negative predictive value.

We applied a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis to evaluate the
performance of the AQ10 with a range of cut-off criteria. The AQ10 did not significantly
predict clinical diagnosis by this criterion either [area under the curve (AUC) 0.55,
p = 0.12] (see online Supplementary Fig. S1).

Fig. 1 shows the distribution of AQ10 scores
according to ASD diagnosis status. There was no significant difference in mean AQ10 scores
between those diagnosed with ASD and those without ASD (ASD mean
7.26, s.d. = 2.28; not-ASD mean 6.85, s.d. = 2.46, t
test, p = 0.12), confirming that AQ10 scores are not predictive of
clinical diagnosis.

Comparison of the AQ10 and AQ50 questionnaires

In a secondary analysis, we examined whether the original AQ50 questionnaire predicts ASD
caseness better than the brief AQ10 (see Table
2). Applying the ‘screening’ cut-off of ⩾26, the AQ50 performed significantly
better than chance (χ2 = 3.976, df = 1, p = 0.046). However,
its predictive power was modest, including high sensitivity (0.88) but very low
specificity (0.20). At the higher ‘clinical’ cut-off of AQ50 ⩾32, performance was no
better than chance (χ2 = 1.265, df = 1, p = 0.261).
Comparison of the AQ informant-report and self-report

The performance of the informant-report AQ50 and AQ10 was similar to that of the
self-report versions of the scale (see Table 2).
The AQ10 (χ2 = 3.658, df = 1, p = 0.056) and AQ50 cut-off ⩾26
(χ2 = 3.785, df = 1, p = 0.052) both predicted caseness
marginally better than chance. The AQ50 cut-off ⩾32 was significantly superior to chance
(χ2 = 8.860, df = 1, p = 0.003), but even here the
specificity was poor (0.38). In the ROC curve analysis of the informant-report AQ50 and
AQ10, these measures performed very similarly to the self-report versions. The informant
AQ50, though not the AQ10, predicted clinical diagnosis slightly better than chance (AUC
0.58, p = 0.017), similarly to the self-report AQ50 (where the AUC was
0.56). The best performance was with a cut-off of ⩾32 at which there was a sensitivity of
0.78 and a specificity of 0.38, and an accuracy of 67% (see online Supplementary Fig.
S2).
Correlations between AQ and the ADOS-G and ADI-R

In order to address the question of whether AQ scores are predictive of the severity of
ASD symptoms as continuous variables, we examined Pearson product-moment correlations
between AQ scores and total scores on the ADOS-G and the ADI-R. ADOS-G totals were the sum
of the communication, social, and repetitive/restricted behaviours domains. ADI-R totals
were the sum of the communication, social, and repetitive domains. ADOS-G totals were not
correlated with either the self-report AQ10 or the AQ50 (all
p > 0.2). In contrast, ADI-R totals were correlated with the
self-report AQ10 (r = 0.12, p = 0.045) and the AQ50
(r = 0.13, p = 0.030), albeit weakly (see Table 3). These results show that self-reported ASD
traits, measured using the AQ, are not correlated with clinician-rated current ASD
behaviours (ADOS-G), but are weakly associated with retrospectively reported early-life
ASD symptoms (ADI-R). The correlation between ADOS-G and ADI-R scores was of trend
significance (r = 0.29, p = 0.072,
n = 40).

Associations between psychiatric disorders (co-morbidities) and AQ scores

We obtained data on co-morbidities for 396 patients (84% of the sample). Across the whole
sample, major depressive disorder was present in 20% of cases, panic/agoraphobia 12%,
generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) 20%, social anxiety/phobia 17%,
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder 16%, and obsessive–compulsive disorder 20%.
Overall, 69% of patients were diagnosed with one or more co-morbidities (see Table 4). 

Rates of co-morbidities in true and false positives, and true and false negatives,
with caseness defined by ASD clinical diagnosis and screening prediction of ASD
defined as AQ10 self-report scores of ⩾6

ASD, Autism spectrum disorder; AQ10, 10-item Autism-Spectrum Quotient.

Compared with true negatives (who scored <6 on the AQ10 and did not receive a
clinical ASD diagnosis), false positives (<6 on the AQ10 but did receive a
diagnosis) were more likely to have GAD (21.1% v. 3.7%,
χ2 = 4.347, df = 1, p = 0.037). This suggests that GAD might
‘mimic’ ASD and lead to false positives on the AQ. In contrast, false negatives were less
likely to have at least one co-morbidity than true positives (61.0% v.
76.1%, χ2 = 5.241, df = 1, p = 0.022). This suggests that
individuals with ‘pure’ ASD, and no co-morbidities, might be more likely to be missed by
the AQ questionnaire. See Table 4 for
co-morbidity rates for each of the four groups (true positive, false positive, true
negative, and false negative).

To discover whether co-morbidities predict AQ scores independent of ASD caseness, we
performed a general linear model (GLM) analysis with AQ10 scores as the dependent
variable. Independent variables (fixed-effect factors) were: clinical ASD diagnosis, and
the six co-morbidities as binary predictors. The GLM revealed that GAD
(p = 0.014) was the only significant predictor of AQ10 scores, while ASD
diagnosis did not predict AQ10 scores (p = 0.537) in this analysis. See
online Supplementary Table S1 for the full GLM results. The AQ questionnaire therefore
seems to be more sensitive to the presence of GAD than it is to ASD in this sample. Those
individuals with ASD who present with no psychiatric co-morbidities may be at risk of
scoring below threshold on the AQ and thus becoming false negatives if the AQ is used as a
screening tool.
Financial implications of using the AQ to triage referrals

In order to put these results into a financial context, we estimated the financial
implications had the BGC clinic adopted the NICE guidelines suggesting that referrals for
ASD assessment should be made for a score of ⩾6 on the AQ10. This does not represent a
comprehensive health economics analysis, as we do not attempt to estimate the value of
receipt of an ASD diagnosis to an adult with ASD, or the cost to society of a case of
undiagnosed ASD.

In our sample of consecutive BGC patients spanning 4 years, 102 (24%) scored 5 or below
on the AQ10. Given that each BGC assessment costs the National Health Service (NHS) £2305
on average, according to a 2011 estimate (Murphy et al.
2011), this implies that a total of £ 235 110
(102 × £2305) could have been saved if all of these ‘AQ10 negative’ individuals had not
received a BGC referral, assuming that all other factors remained equal. However, 71 of
those 102 referrals went on to receive a clinical diagnosis of ASD at the BGC, that is,
70% of the ‘negatives’ proved to be false negatives. Therefore, for every 10 patients
denied a referral, £ 23 050 would have been saved but seven ASD cases would go
undiagnosed. For every £3300 (£ 235 000/71) saved, an individual with ASD would miss out
on a diagnosis.

Regarding the issue of false positives, of the 425 referrals, 323 (76%) scored 6 or above
on the AQ10 and would have been offered a referral under the NICE guidelines. However, of
these 323, 79 (24%) were diagnosed as not having an ASD at the clinical assessment. As
each assessment costs £2305, these false positives on the AQ10 would have cost the NHS £
182 095 (79 x £2305) over the 4 years of the study, or about £ 45 000 per year. Some of
these patients may have benefited from their BGC assessment despite not receiving an ASD
diagnosis, e.g. by receiving a diagnosis of another psychiatric disorder. However, 30 of
the 79 (38%) AQ10 ‘false positives’ were not assessed as having any psychiatric
disorder.

Discussion

We investigated the AQ questionnaire as a predictor of ASD caseness in a large sample of
adults referred to our diagnostic clinic with suspected ASD. Our objective was to determine
if the AQ would be an effective means of ‘gating’ clinical referrals, as recommended by the
UK NICE guidelines (NICE, 2012). We found little
evidence that the AQ could predict who would receive a clinical diagnosis of ASD in our
sample. The brief AQ10 questionnaire was no better than chance as a predictor of ASD
diagnosis, providing high sensitivity (0.77) but low specificity (0.29). Nearly two-thirds
of the patients who scored below the cut-off score of 6 were ‘false negatives’, i.e. they
went on to receive a diagnosis of ASD. The longer version of the questionnaire, the AQ50,
performed only marginally better.

These results contrast with some prior findings. In two large studies (Allison et
al.
2012; Booth et al.
2013), the AQ10 was found to discriminate well
between ASD adults and healthy controls. However, Brugha et al. (2011b) found that it only modestly
predicted ASD caseness within a large general population sample. In that study, the AQ had a
sensitivity of 0.73 and a specificity of 0.62 when acting as a predictor of scoring above
the threshold of 10 points on the ADOS-G, and AQ scores were significantly, but weakly,
correlated with ADOS-G total symptoms (r = 0.24). In our sample we found a
comparable sensitivity, but a substantially lower specificity, and no significant
correlation between the ADOS-G and the AQ.

Why does the ability of the AQ to predict ASD diagnosis vary across studies? One plausible
explanation is differences in the nature of the non-ASD group. The AQ shows excellent
performance (Allison et al.
2012; Booth et al.
2013) in distinguishing ASD cases from healthy
controls recruited from the general population. However, such case–control studies are known
to overestimate the accuracy of diagnostic tests (Lijmer et al.
1999; Rutjes et al.
2006). Our study did not use a case–control design,
and our results suggest that the AQ differentiates poorly between true cases of ASD, and
individuals from the same clinical population who do not have ASD (Simonoff et al.
2008; Freeth et al.
2012; L Underwood et al.,
unpublished observations). Furthermore, we show that scores on the AQ were not correlated
with current ASD symptoms as measured with the ADOS-G. AQ scores did predict scores on the
ADI-R, a retrospective measure of childhood symptoms, but only weakly.

If the AQ, in its current form, is poorly predictive of ASD diagnosis in a clinical
setting, why is this? One possible explanation is that individuals with ASD lack insight
into their own behaviour (Bishop & Seltzer, 2012) and so find it difficult to self-report their own symptoms. However, against
this hypothesis, we found that even when an informant completed the AQ, scores only
marginally predicted clinical diagnosis, and did not correlate with ADOS-G symptoms. While
the informant AQ was more predictive of ADI-R scores, this may reflect the fact that the
ADI-R is itself an informant measure and the same informant completed both.

Therefore, a lack of self-insight may not fully account for the frequent discrepancies
between the AQ and other ASD measures. Co-morbidities may go some way to explain this issue.
We found that the presence of ASD is not an independent predictor of AQ10 scores but GAD
does predict higher AQ10 scores. Thus, GAD may contribute to false positives. We speculate
that the AQ may be sensitive to anxiety because several AQ items take the form of
self-evaluations, e.g. ‘I find it difficult to work out people's intentions’. Anxious
individuals commonly lack confidence in their social abilities (Mathews & MacLeod,
2005) and it is possible that this low
self-esteem might manifest as ASD-typical answers. Clinicians performing an ASD assessment,
however, are able to use their judgement to distinguish between ASD and other conditions
that can mimic ASD symptoms. We also showed that ASD individuals without co-morbidities
tended to score low on the AQ, perhaps putting them at risk of becoming ‘false negative’
cases, those who had ASD but scored <6 on the AQ10.

Our results have implications for both clinical services and for future research. From a
clinical perspective, we suggest that the adoption of the AQ as a clinical tool (as
recommended by NICE) (NICE, 2012) will need to be
guided by an assessment of the costs and benefits in relation to the particular patient
population in which its use is proposed. We have shown that, in a population with suspected
ASD seen at a national specialist diagnostic clinic, the sensitivity of the AQ is
acceptable, but the specificity is poor, and the overall performance is little better than
chance. As regards implications for future research, our findings highlight the need for
measures of ASD symptoms that are suitable for use in the population with suspected ASD. It
is possible that a subset of AQ50 items might be more effective than the AQ50 or the AQ10
subset that we examined. Alternatively, another ASD trait questionnaire might prove more
suitable, for instance the Autism Spectrum Disorders in Adults Screening Questionnaire
(ASDASQ) (Nylander & Gillberg, 2001).
Finally, a novel scale more predictive of ASD diagnosis might be developed through a study
of how clinicians discriminate ASD from ‘ASD-like’ symptoms.

Our study has a number of limitations. First, our study population was limited to one
clinic, the BGC, which is a national referral centre. It remains to be determined how well
our results would generalize to other clinical services. It is possible, for instance, that
the AQ might perform better in screening the referrals received by smaller local ASD
services, which receive a higher proportion of referrals from primary and secondary care.
Future research should explore this possibility. Next, a limitation of this retrospective
study was that we did not produce a published study protocol, and no a
priori power calculations were performed. This was a retrospective analysis, rather
than a prospective study designed to address a particular question. A further limitation is
that we did not obtain intelligence quotient (IQ) scores for our participants. IQ has been
shown to correlate with AQ scores (Bishop & Seltzer, 2012) but may be negatively associated with ADOS severity (Klin
et al.
2007); therefore it would have been desirable to
measure IQ as a potential confound. Similarly, while we had qualitative measures of
psychiatric co-morbidity, i.e. ICD-10 diagnoses, we lacked continuous measures of the
severity of these symptoms and so could not address these as confounds in a quantitative
manner. We calculated the AQ10 scores by summing the appropriate items from the AQ50, rather
than by administering the AQ10 as a questionnaire per se. It is possible
that our results would be different had we done so. A final limitation is that we only
examined the ADOS-G and ADI-R as ASD diagnostic tools, and did not evaluate other
instruments, such as the Diagnostic Interview for Social and Communication Disorders
schedule (Wing et al.
2002).

In conclusion, we report that the AQ did not predict ASD caseness in a large sample of
patients seen at an adult ASD diagnostic service. Therefore, the utility of the AQ for
triaging ASD referrals in those with suspected ASD is called into question. Being diagnosed
with ASD can represent a turning point for patients – and 85% of UK adults diagnosed with an
ASD were glad to receive the diagnosis (Jones et al.
2014). These results suggest that, in the diagnosis
of ASD, self-report questionnaire measures may not yet be able to substitute for specialist
clinical assessments.

Acknowledgements

Many adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) remain undiagnosed. Specialist
assessment clinics enable the detection of these cases, but such services are often
overstretched. It has been proposed that unnecessary referrals to these services could
be reduced by prioritizing individuals who score highly on the Autism-Spectrum Quotient
(AQ), a self-report questionnaire measure of autistic traits. However, the ability of
the AQ to predict who will go on to receive a diagnosis of ASD in adults is unclear.

We studied 476 adults, seen consecutively at a national ASD diagnostic referral service
for suspected ASD. We tested AQ scores as predictors of ASD diagnosis made by expert
clinicians according to International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 criteria,
informed by the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-Generic (ADOS-G) and Autism
Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) assessments.

Of the participants, 73% received a clinical diagnosis of ASD. Self-report AQ scores
did not significantly predict receipt of a diagnosis. While AQ scores provided high
sensitivity of 0.77 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72–0.82] and positive predictive
value of 0.76 (95% CI 0.70–0.80), the specificity of 0.29 (95% CI 0.20–0.38) and
negative predictive value of 0.36 (95% CI 0.22–0.40) were low. Thus, 64% of those who
scored below the AQ cut-off were ‘false negatives’ who did in fact have ASD.
Co-morbidity data revealed that generalized anxiety disorder may ‘mimic’ ASD and inflate
AQ scores, leading to false positives.

The AQ's utility for screening referrals was limited in this sample. Recommendations
supporting the AQ's role in the assessment of adult ASD, e.g. UK NICE guidelines, may
need to be reconsidered.

Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a family of lifelong neurodevelopmental syndromes with
a prevalence of at least 1% (Baird et al.
2006; Baron-Cohen et al.
2009; Brugha et al.
2011a; Developmental Disabilities
Monitoring Network Surveillance Year 2010 Principal
Investigators, 2014). In the UK, it is estimated that each case of ASD is associated with
average total lifetime costs of nearly £1 million (Buescher et al.
2014). Early and accurate diagnosis of ASD is
crucial to enable affected individuals to receive treatment and support (Koegel et
al.
2014). Nonetheless, ASD frequently goes undiagnosed
into adulthood, which causes avoidable distress and morbidity (Geurts & Jansen,
2012; Nylander et al.
2013). Indeed, undiagnosed ASD is increasingly
recognized as a significant problem in general adult psychiatry, and as an important
differential diagnosis in this setting (Tebartz van Elst et al.
2013). Diagnosis of previously undetected ASD in
adults is therefore key to managing the disorder, yet as there are no reliable biomarkers
for ASD (Horder & Murphy, 2012), diagnosis
relies on lengthy and costly expert clinical assessments. The capacity of adult ASD
diagnostic services is, therefore, stretched.

In light of the fact that resource limitations can delay or prevent individuals from
receiving a needed ASD assessment, it has been proposed that a means to ‘gate’ or triage
referrals to such services is desirable. In particular, the Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ), a
self-report questionnaire (Baron-Cohen et al.
2001), has been suggested as a means of quickly and
cost-effectively estimating ASD risk and thus guiding referrals. The UK National Institute
for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recently endorsed the AQ for this purpose
(Woodbury-Smith et al.
2005; NICE, 2012). NICE recommends that individuals with ‘possible autism’ should be offered a
referral to a specialist diagnostic service if they score above the threshold (6 or more out
of 10) on the AQ questionnaire.

However, it is not clear how well the AQ is suitable for the role of referral screening.
While the AQ has been shown to discriminate well between individuals with diagnosed ASD and
healthy controls (Baron-Cohen et al.
2001; Wakabayashi et al.
2006; Booth et al.
2013), little is known about whether the AQ can
predict ASD diagnosis in adults with suspected ASD. One previous study (Ketelaars et
al.
2008) found that the AQ was unable to predict ASD
diagnosis within a clinically suspected population, although the sample size was small (21
ASD cases). Two other groups have reported that the AQ's performance in predicting ASD
diagnosis was excellent (Woodbury-Smith et al.
2005) or fair (Sizoo et al.
2015). Yet no study to date has examined whether
other psychiatric disorders (co-morbidities), such as anxiety or depression, act as
confounds in the relationship between AQ scores and ASD diagnosis. This is a limitation,
since co-morbidities are common in patients presenting for a diagnostic evaluation. Nor is
it known whether the AQ predicts scores on the so-called ‘gold-standard’ (Baird et
al.
2006) formal diagnostic assessments for ASD, the
Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-Generic (ADOS-G) or the Autism Diagnostic
Interview-Revised (ADI-R).

Therefore, we conducted the present study in order to, for the first time, examine the
performance of the AQ questionnaire as a predictor of the outcome of an expert clinical ASD
assessment, and the ADOS and ADI, in adults referred to a specialist diagnostic service with
possible ASD, who were also assessed for co-morbidities. We studied a large sample of
patients seen at a specialist diagnostic referral service. We examined the 10-item AQ10
version of the questionnaire (Booth et al.
2013), which is recommended in the NICE guidelines,
and also the original 50-item version of the scale (AQ50). Our objective was to test the
suitability of the AQ for ASD screening in the context prescribed by NICE.

This study included 476 patients seen at the Behavioural Genetics Clinic (BGC) at the
Maudsley Hospital in London, England. The BGC is a National Specialist Centre that accepts
referrals from across the UK. The BGC offers a comprehensive psychiatric assessment;
however, the focus is on the diagnosis of ASD, and the BGC only accepts referrals where
the primary suspected diagnosis is ASD. The present sample represents all of the patients
seen (consecutive admissions) at the BGC clinic over the period from September 2009 to May
2013. This is because, in September 2009 the BGC clinic added the AQ to the clinical
questionnaire pack sent to all patients before their assessment, and in May 2013 the
decision was taken to begin the current analysis of the AQ data. The only selection
criteria were age 18+ years and giving informed consent. Over the period of this study,
primary care (general practitioners) accounted for 37.7% of the referrals to the BGC,
tertiary care 52.9%, and other sources 9.3%.

Screening measures included the brief AQ10 questionnaire, and the full-length AQ50.
Participants completed the AQ50, and we derived AQ10 scores from these answers, according
to Allison et al. (2012). AQ10
scores are calculated by summing the following 10 items from the AQ50 questionnaire: items
5, 20, 27, 28, 31, 32, 36, 37, 41 and 45. These items were selected by Allison et
al. (2012) on the basis that they best
discriminated (i.e. have the highest discrimination index) between ASD patients and
healthy controls. The original Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ50) contains 50 questions,
relating to social skill, attention switching, attention to detail, communication and
imagination. Each item has four possible responses (‘definitely agree’, ‘slightly agree’,
‘slightly disagree’, ‘definitely disagree’). Respondents are instructed to select one
response per item. Items are scored dichotomously (i.e. collapsing ‘definitely agree’ and
‘slightly agree’ into ‘agree’ and similarly for ‘disagree’), with one point being assigned
for each response characteristic of ASD. Total AQ50 scores therefore range from 0 to 50,
with higher scores indicating more autistic traits. The published cut-off value for the
AQ10 is ⩾6, i.e. scores of 6 or above are considered positive for ASD (Allison et
al.
2012). For the AQ50, we compared two previously
described cut-offs: the ‘clinical’ threshold of ⩾32 and the ‘screening’ cut-off of ⩾26
(Baron-Cohen et al.
2001). All questionnaires were administered in
English.

Additionally, we investigated a novel variant of the AQ modified as an informant-rated
scale. This measure, which has not been previously validated, was introduced in the BGC
clinic to explore its potential as a non-self report measure of ASD symptoms and
difficulties. A family member or close friend of the participant completed the informant
AQ50. All of the questions were taken from the original AQ but re-worded to the
gender-neutral third person. For example, AQ50 item 1: ‘I prefer to do things with others
rather than on my own’ was changed to ‘S/he prefers to do things with others rather than
on his/her own’. The informant AQ10 was derived in the same way as the self-report
version. All questionnaires were administered in English.

Two formal ASD assessments are used in the BGC service: the ADOS-G (Lord et al.
2000) and the ADI-R (Lord et al.
1994). Experienced clinicians or clinical
research workers administered these assessments. A clinical expert judgement (diagnosis)
was made.

The ADOS-G is a measure of current ASD symptoms. The assessment comprises a structured
activity session and semi-structured interview that includes a series of social presses
and other opportunities intended to elicit behaviours associated with ASD. ADOS-G module
4, designed for verbally fluent adolescents and adults, was used.

The ADI-R is a parent/primary caregiver interview focused on developmental history of
ASD-specific behaviours. The ADI-R is a measure of early-life symptoms. Scores are
aggregated into symptom clusters that correspond to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV) criteria for a diagnosis of autism (Lord et
al.
1994).

Clinical diagnosis was made in a diagnostic meeting by consensus amongst a
multidisciplinary team, including consultant psychiatrists, psychologists, psychiatry
senior house officers (residents), specialist nurses and clinical research workers, using
International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 research criteria and informed by the
patient's ADOS-G and ADI-R scores. For this study, any autism-spectrum diagnosis was
considered ‘ASD’, including diagnoses of autism and Asperger's syndrome.

Reflecting clinical practice at the BGC service, the ADI-R was always performed first if
possible (i.e. if the parent or caregiver was alive and willing to be interviewed, and the
patient provided consent for us to speak with them). If the ADI-R could not be performed,
or if the outcome of the ADI-R was unclear, the ADOS-G was completed. Therefore some
patients received an ADI-R only, some received an ADOS-G only, and a minority received
both an ADI-R and an ADOS-G (these patients represented the more complex cases.)

A total of 476 adult patients were seen at the BGC clinic during the period of the study.
Self-rated AQ50 scores were available for 456 of these (96%) and AQ10 scores were
subsequently calculated for 428 (90%) (see online Supplementary Method). Of the patients,
473 (99%) received a clinical consensus expert diagnosis, 210 (44%) received an ADOS-G
assessment, 305 (64%) received an ADI-R, of which 40 received both ADOS-G and ADI-R. No
a priori sample size calculation was performed because these data were
originally collected for clinical purposes.

(co-morbidities), the BGC assessment procedures, data analysis and the treatment of

All procedures contributing to this work comply with the ethical standards of the
relevant UK and institutional guidelines and with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as
revised in 2008. All participants provided written consent to use outcome measures and
clinical data for research purposes, and the study was approved by the National Research
Ethics Service (NRES) Ethics Committee London – South East (ref: 12/LO/0790).

The sample of 476 adults included 355 males (75%) and 121 females (25%). Age ranged from
18 to 70 years, with a median age of 29 years. Of the participants, 115 (24%) were aged 21
years or younger. Of the patients, 346 (73%) were assigned a diagnosis of ASD by the
clinical team at the BGC (see Table 1).


Patient characteristics

spectrum disorder.

The AQ10, with a cut-off of ⩾6, did not predict ASD diagnosis better than chance
[χ2 = 1.423, degrees of freedom (df) = 1, p = 0.233]. While
the test showed high sensitivity (0.77) as a predictor of receiving an ASD diagnosis, its
specificity was less good (0.29) (see Table 2).
The positive predictive value was high (0.76), indicating that three-quarters of those
scoring ⩾6 on the AQ10 did receive a clinical diagnosis of ASD. However, the low negative
predictive value (0.36) implies that nearly two-thirds of those who scored below the ⩾6
AQ10 cut-off, predicted not to receive an ASD diagnosis, in fact were diagnosed with ASD.

predict clinical diagnosis by this criterion either [area under the curve (AUC) 0.55,
p = 0.12] (see online Supplementary Fig. S1).

Fig. 1 shows the distribution of AQ10 scores
according to ASD diagnosis status. There was no significant difference in mean AQ10 scores
between those diagnosed with ASD and those without ASD (ASD mean
7.26, s.d. = 2.28; not-ASD mean 6.85, s.d. = 2.46, t
test, p = 0.12), confirming that AQ10 scores are not predictive of
clinical diagnosis.

In a secondary analysis, we examined whether the original AQ50 questionnaire predicts ASD
caseness better than the brief AQ10 (see Table
2). Applying the ‘screening’ cut-off of ⩾26, the AQ50 performed significantly
better than chance (χ2 = 3.976, df = 1, p = 0.046). However,
its predictive power was modest, including high sensitivity (0.88) but very low
specificity (0.20). At the higher ‘clinical’ cut-off of AQ50 ⩾32, performance was no
better than chance (χ2 = 1.265, df = 1, p = 0.261).

The performance of the informant-report AQ50 and AQ10 was similar to that of the
self-report versions of the scale (see Table 2).
The AQ10 (χ2 = 3.658, df = 1, p = 0.056) and AQ50 cut-off ⩾26
(χ2 = 3.785, df = 1, p = 0.052) both predicted caseness
marginally better than chance. The AQ50 cut-off ⩾32 was significantly superior to chance
(χ2 = 8.860, df = 1, p = 0.003), but even here the
specificity was poor (0.38). In the ROC curve analysis of the informant-report AQ50 and
AQ10, these measures performed very similarly to the self-report versions. The informant
AQ50, though not the AQ10, predicted clinical diagnosis slightly better than chance (AUC
0.58, p = 0.017), similarly to the self-report AQ50 (where the AUC was
0.56). The best performance was with a cut-off of ⩾32 at which there was a sensitivity of
0.78 and a specificity of 0.38, and an accuracy of 67% (see online Supplementary Fig.
S2).

In order to address the question of whether AQ scores are predictive of the severity of
ASD symptoms as continuous variables, we examined Pearson product-moment correlations
between AQ scores and total scores on the ADOS-G and the ADI-R. ADOS-G totals were the sum
of the communication, social, and repetitive/restricted behaviours domains. ADI-R totals
were the sum of the communication, social, and repetitive domains. ADOS-G totals were not
correlated with either the self-report AQ10 or the AQ50 (all
p > 0.2). In contrast, ADI-R totals were correlated with the
self-report AQ10 (r = 0.12, p = 0.045) and the AQ50
(r = 0.13, p = 0.030), albeit weakly (see Table 3). These results show that self-reported ASD
traits, measured using the AQ, are not correlated with clinician-rated current ASD
behaviours (ADOS-G), but are weakly associated with retrospectively reported early-life
ASD symptoms (ADI-R). The correlation between ADOS-G and ADI-R scores was of trend
significance (r = 0.29, p = 0.072,
n = 40).

We obtained data on co-morbidities for 396 patients (84% of the sample). Across the whole
sample, major depressive disorder was present in 20% of cases, panic/agoraphobia 12%,
generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) 20%, social anxiety/phobia 17%,
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder 16%, and obsessive–compulsive disorder 20%.
Overall, 69% of patients were diagnosed with one or more co-morbidities (see Table 4). 

Rates of co-morbidities in true and false positives, and true and false negatives,
with caseness defined by ASD clinical diagnosis and screening prediction of ASD
defined as AQ10 self-report scores of ⩾6

ASD, Autism spectrum disorder; AQ10, 10-item Autism-Spectrum Quotient.

Compared with true negatives (who scored <6 on the AQ10 and did not receive a
clinical ASD diagnosis), false positives (<6 on the AQ10 but did receive a
diagnosis) were more likely to have GAD (21.1% v. 3.7%,
χ2 = 4.347, df = 1, p = 0.037). This suggests that GAD might
‘mimic’ ASD and lead to false positives on the AQ. In contrast, false negatives were less
likely to have at least one co-morbidity than true positives (61.0% v.
76.1%, χ2 = 5.241, df = 1, p = 0.022). This suggests that
individuals with ‘pure’ ASD, and no co-morbidities, might be more likely to be missed by
the AQ questionnaire. See Table 4 for
co-morbidity rates for each of the four groups (true positive, false positive, true
negative, and false negative).

To discover whether co-morbidities predict AQ scores independent of ASD caseness, we
performed a general linear model (GLM) analysis with AQ10 scores as the dependent
variable. Independent variables (fixed-effect factors) were: clinical ASD diagnosis, and
the six co-morbidities as binary predictors. The GLM revealed that GAD
(p = 0.014) was the only significant predictor of AQ10 scores, while ASD
diagnosis did not predict AQ10 scores (p = 0.537) in this analysis. See
online Supplementary Table S1 for the full GLM results. The AQ questionnaire therefore
seems to be more sensitive to the presence of GAD than it is to ASD in this sample. Those
individuals with ASD who present with no psychiatric co-morbidities may be at risk of
scoring below threshold on the AQ and thus becoming false negatives if the AQ is used as a
screening tool.

In order to put these results into a financial context, we estimated the financial
implications had the BGC clinic adopted the NICE guidelines suggesting that referrals for
ASD assessment should be made for a score of ⩾6 on the AQ10. This does not represent a
comprehensive health economics analysis, as we do not attempt to estimate the value of
receipt of an ASD diagnosis to an adult with ASD, or the cost to society of a case of
undiagnosed ASD.

In our sample of consecutive BGC patients spanning 4 years, 102 (24%) scored 5 or below
on the AQ10. Given that each BGC assessment costs the National Health Service (NHS) £2305
on average, according to a 2011 estimate (Murphy et al.
2011), this implies that a total of £ 235 110
(102 × £2305) could have been saved if all of these ‘AQ10 negative’ individuals had not
received a BGC referral, assuming that all other factors remained equal. However, 71 of
those 102 referrals went on to receive a clinical diagnosis of ASD at the BGC, that is,
70% of the ‘negatives’ proved to be false negatives. Therefore, for every 10 patients
denied a referral, £ 23 050 would have been saved but seven ASD cases would go
undiagnosed. For every £3300 (£ 235 000/71) saved, an individual with ASD would miss out
on a diagnosis.

Regarding the issue of false positives, of the 425 referrals, 323 (76%) scored 6 or above
on the AQ10 and would have been offered a referral under the NICE guidelines. However, of
these 323, 79 (24%) were diagnosed as not having an ASD at the clinical assessment. As
each assessment costs £2305, these false positives on the AQ10 would have cost the NHS £
182 095 (79 x £2305) over the 4 years of the study, or about £ 45 000 per year. Some of
these patients may have benefited from their BGC assessment despite not receiving an ASD
diagnosis, e.g. by receiving a diagnosis of another psychiatric disorder. However, 30 of
the 79 (38%) AQ10 ‘false positives’ were not assessed as having any psychiatric
disorder.

We investigated the AQ questionnaire as a predictor of ASD caseness in a large sample of
adults referred to our diagnostic clinic with suspected ASD. Our objective was to determine
if the AQ would be an effective means of ‘gating’ clinical referrals, as recommended by the
UK NICE guidelines (NICE, 2012). We found little
evidence that the AQ could predict who would receive a clinical diagnosis of ASD in our
sample. The brief AQ10 questionnaire was no better than chance as a predictor of ASD
diagnosis, providing high sensitivity (0.77) but low specificity (0.29). Nearly two-thirds
of the patients who scored below the cut-off score of 6 were ‘false negatives’, i.e. they
went on to receive a diagnosis of ASD. The longer version of the questionnaire, the AQ50,
performed only marginally better.

These results contrast with some prior findings. In two large studies (Allison et
al.
2012; Booth et al.
2013), the AQ10 was found to discriminate well
between ASD adults and healthy controls. However, Brugha et al. (2011b) found that it only modestly
predicted ASD caseness within a large general population sample. In that study, the AQ had a
sensitivity of 0.73 and a specificity of 0.62 when acting as a predictor of scoring above
the threshold of 10 points on the ADOS-G, and AQ scores were significantly, but weakly,
correlated with ADOS-G total symptoms (r = 0.24). In our sample we found a
comparable sensitivity, but a substantially lower specificity, and no significant
correlation between the ADOS-G and the AQ.

Why does the ability of the AQ to predict ASD diagnosis vary across studies? One plausible
explanation is differences in the nature of the non-ASD group. The AQ shows excellent
performance (Allison et al.
2012; Booth et al.
2013) in distinguishing ASD cases from healthy
controls recruited from the general population. However, such case–control studies are known
to overestimate the accuracy of diagnostic tests (Lijmer et al.
1999; Rutjes et al.
2006). Our study did not use a case–control design,
and our results suggest that the AQ differentiates poorly between true cases of ASD, and
individuals from the same clinical population who do not have ASD (Simonoff et al.
2008; Freeth et al.
2012; L Underwood et al.,
unpublished observations). Furthermore, we show that scores on the AQ were not correlated
with current ASD symptoms as measured with the ADOS-G. AQ scores did predict scores on the
ADI-R, a retrospective measure of childhood symptoms, but only weakly.

If the AQ, in its current form, is poorly predictive of ASD diagnosis in a clinical
setting, why is this? One possible explanation is that individuals with ASD lack insight
into their own behaviour (Bishop & Seltzer, 2012) and so find it difficult to self-report their own symptoms. However, against
this hypothesis, we found that even when an informant completed the AQ, scores only
marginally predicted clinical diagnosis, and did not correlate with ADOS-G symptoms. While
the informant AQ was more predictive of ADI-R scores, this may reflect the fact that the
ADI-R is itself an informant measure and the same informant completed both.

Therefore, a lack of self-insight may not fully account for the frequent discrepancies
between the AQ and other ASD measures. Co-morbidities may go some way to explain this issue.
We found that the presence of ASD is not an independent predictor of AQ10 scores but GAD
does predict higher AQ10 scores. Thus, GAD may contribute to false positives. We speculate
that the AQ may be sensitive to anxiety because several AQ items take the form of
self-evaluations, e.g. ‘I find it difficult to work out people's intentions’. Anxious
individuals commonly lack confidence in their social abilities (Mathews & MacLeod,
2005) and it is possible that this low
self-esteem might manifest as ASD-typical answers. Clinicians performing an ASD assessment,
however, are able to use their judgement to distinguish between ASD and other conditions
that can mimic ASD symptoms. We also showed that ASD individuals without co-morbidities
tended to score low on the AQ, perhaps putting them at risk of becoming ‘false negative’
cases, those who had ASD but scored <6 on the AQ10.

Our results have implications for both clinical services and for future research. From a
clinical perspective, we suggest that the adoption of the AQ as a clinical tool (as
recommended by NICE) (NICE, 2012) will need to be
guided by an assessment of the costs and benefits in relation to the particular patient
population in which its use is proposed. We have shown that, in a population with suspected
ASD seen at a national specialist diagnostic clinic, the sensitivity of the AQ is
acceptable, but the specificity is poor, and the overall performance is little better than
chance. As regards implications for future research, our findings highlight the need for
measures of ASD symptoms that are suitable for use in the population with suspected ASD. It
is possible that a subset of AQ50 items might be more effective than the AQ50 or the AQ10
subset that we examined. Alternatively, another ASD trait questionnaire might prove more
suitable, for instance the Autism Spectrum Disorders in Adults Screening Questionnaire
(ASDASQ) (Nylander & Gillberg, 2001).
Finally, a novel scale more predictive of ASD diagnosis might be developed through a study
of how clinicians discriminate ASD from ‘ASD-like’ symptoms.

Our study has a number of limitations. First, our study population was limited to one
clinic, the BGC, which is a national referral centre. It remains to be determined how well
our results would generalize to other clinical services. It is possible, for instance, that
the AQ might perform better in screening the referrals received by smaller local ASD
services, which receive a higher proportion of referrals from primary and secondary care.
Future research should explore this possibility. Next, a limitation of this retrospective
study was that we did not produce a published study protocol, and no a
priori power calculations were performed. This was a retrospective analysis, rather
than a prospective study designed to address a particular question. A further limitation is
that we did not obtain intelligence quotient (IQ) scores for our participants. IQ has been
shown to correlate with AQ scores (Bishop & Seltzer, 2012) but may be negatively associated with ADOS severity (Klin
et al.
2007); therefore it would have been desirable to
measure IQ as a potential confound. Similarly, while we had qualitative measures of
psychiatric co-morbidity, i.e. ICD-10 diagnoses, we lacked continuous measures of the
severity of these symptoms and so could not address these as confounds in a quantitative
manner. We calculated the AQ10 scores by summing the appropriate items from the AQ50, rather
than by administering the AQ10 as a questionnaire per se. It is possible
that our results would be different had we done so. A final limitation is that we only
examined the ADOS-G and ADI-R as ASD diagnostic tools, and did not evaluate other
instruments, such as the Diagnostic Interview for Social and Communication Disorders
schedule (Wing et al.
2002).

In conclusion, we report that the AQ did not predict ASD caseness in a large sample of
patients seen at an adult ASD diagnostic service. Therefore, the utility of the AQ for
triaging ASD referrals in those with suspected ASD is called into question. Being diagnosed
with ASD can represent a turning point for patients – and 85% of UK adults diagnosed with an
ASD were glad to receive the diagnosis (Jones et al.
2014). These results suggest that, in the diagnosis
of ASD, self-report questionnaire measures may not yet be able to substitute for specialist
clinical assessments.

Many adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) remain undiagnosed. Specialist
assessment clinics enable the detection of these cases, but such services are often
overstretched. It has been proposed that unnecessary referrals to these services could
be reduced by prioritizing individuals who score highly on the Autism-Spectrum Quotient
(AQ), a self-report questionnaire measure of autistic traits. However, the ability of
the AQ to predict who will go on to receive a diagnosis of ASD in adults is unclear.

We studied 476 adults, seen consecutively at a national ASD diagnostic referral service
for suspected ASD. We tested AQ scores as predictors of ASD diagnosis made by expert
clinicians according to International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 criteria,
informed by the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-Generic (ADOS-G) and Autism
Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) assessments.

Of the participants, 73% received a clinical diagnosis of ASD. Self-report AQ scores
did not significantly predict receipt of a diagnosis. While AQ scores provided high
sensitivity of 0.77 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72–0.82] and positive predictive
value of 0.76 (95% CI 0.70–0.80), the specificity of 0.29 (95% CI 0.20–0.38) and
negative predictive value of 0.36 (95% CI 0.22–0.40) were low. Thus, 64% of those who
scored below the AQ cut-off were ‘false negatives’ who did in fact have ASD.
Co-morbidity data revealed that generalized anxiety disorder may ‘mimic’ ASD and inflate
AQ scores, leading to false positives.

The AQ's utility for screening referrals was limited in this sample. Recommendations
supporting the AQ's role in the assessment of adult ASD, e.g. UK NICE guidelines, may
need to be reconsidered.

Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a family of lifelong neurodevelopmental syndromes with
a prevalence of at least 1% (Baird et al.
2006; Baron-Cohen et al.
2009; Brugha et al.
2011a; Developmental Disabilities
Monitoring Network Surveillance Year 2010 Principal
Investigators, 2014). In the UK, it is estimated that each case of ASD is associated with
average total lifetime costs of nearly £1 million (Buescher et al.
2014). Early and accurate diagnosis of ASD is
crucial to enable affected individuals to receive treatment and support (Koegel et
al.
2014). Nonetheless, ASD frequently goes undiagnosed
into adulthood, which causes avoidable distress and morbidity (Geurts & Jansen,
2012; Nylander et al.
2013). Indeed, undiagnosed ASD is increasingly
recognized as a significant problem in general adult psychiatry, and as an important
differential diagnosis in this setting (Tebartz van Elst et al.
2013). Diagnosis of previously undetected ASD in
adults is therefore key to managing the disorder, yet as there are no reliable biomarkers
for ASD (Horder & Murphy, 2012), diagnosis
relies on lengthy and costly expert clinical assessments. The capacity of adult ASD
diagnostic services is, therefore, stretched.

In light of the fact that resource limitations can delay or prevent individuals from
receiving a needed ASD assessment, it has been proposed that a means to ‘gate’ or triage
referrals to such services is desirable. In particular, the Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ), a
self-report questionnaire (Baron-Cohen et al.
2001), has been suggested as a means of quickly and
cost-effectively estimating ASD risk and thus guiding referrals. The UK National Institute
for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recently endorsed the AQ for this purpose
(Woodbury-Smith et al.
2005; NICE, 2012). NICE recommends that individuals with ‘possible autism’ should be offered a
referral to a specialist diagnostic service if they score above the threshold (6 or more out
of 10) on the AQ questionnaire.

However, it is not clear how well the AQ is suitable for the role of referral screening.
While the AQ has been shown to discriminate well between individuals with diagnosed ASD and
healthy controls (Baron-Cohen et al.
2001; Wakabayashi et al.
2006; Booth et al.
2013), little is known about whether the AQ can
predict ASD diagnosis in adults with suspected ASD. One previous study (Ketelaars et
al.
2008) found that the AQ was unable to predict ASD
diagnosis within a clinically suspected population, although the sample size was small (21
ASD cases). Two other groups have reported that the AQ's performance in predicting ASD
diagnosis was excellent (Woodbury-Smith et al.
2005) or fair (Sizoo et al.
2015). Yet no study to date has examined whether
other psychiatric disorders (co-morbidities), such as anxiety or depression, act as
confounds in the relationship between AQ scores and ASD diagnosis. This is a limitation,
since co-morbidities are common in patients presenting for a diagnostic evaluation. Nor is
it known whether the AQ predicts scores on the so-called ‘gold-standard’ (Baird et
al.
2006) formal diagnostic assessments for ASD, the
Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-Generic (ADOS-G) or the Autism Diagnostic
Interview-Revised (ADI-R).

Therefore, we conducted the present study in order to, for the first time, examine the
performance of the AQ questionnaire as a predictor of the outcome of an expert clinical ASD
assessment, and the ADOS and ADI, in adults referred to a specialist diagnostic service with
possible ASD, who were also assessed for co-morbidities. We studied a large sample of
patients seen at a specialist diagnostic referral service. We examined the 10-item AQ10
version of the questionnaire (Booth et al.
2013), which is recommended in the NICE guidelines,
and also the original 50-item version of the scale (AQ50). Our objective was to test the
suitability of the AQ for ASD screening in the context prescribed by NICE.

This study included 476 patients seen at the Behavioural Genetics Clinic (BGC) at the
Maudsley Hospital in London, England. The BGC is a National Specialist Centre that accepts
referrals from across the UK. The BGC offers a comprehensive psychiatric assessment;
however, the focus is on the diagnosis of ASD, and the BGC only accepts referrals where
the primary suspected diagnosis is ASD. The present sample represents all of the patients
seen (consecutive admissions) at the BGC clinic over the period from September 2009 to May
2013. This is because, in September 2009 the BGC clinic added the AQ to the clinical
questionnaire pack sent to all patients before their assessment, and in May 2013 the
decision was taken to begin the current analysis of the AQ data. The only selection
criteria were age 18+ years and giving informed consent. Over the period of this study,
primary care (general practitioners) accounted for 37.7% of the referrals to the BGC,
tertiary care 52.9%, and other sources 9.3%.

Screening measures included the brief AQ10 questionnaire, and the full-length AQ50.
Participants completed the AQ50, and we derived AQ10 scores from these answers, according
to Allison et al. (2012). AQ10
scores are calculated by summing the following 10 items from the AQ50 questionnaire: items
5, 20, 27, 28, 31, 32, 36, 37, 41 and 45. These items were selected by Allison et
al. (2012) on the basis that they best
discriminated (i.e. have the highest discrimination index) between ASD patients and
healthy controls. The original Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ50) contains 50 questions,
relating to social skill, attention switching, attention to detail, communication and
imagination. Each item has four possible responses (‘definitely agree’, ‘slightly agree’,
‘slightly disagree’, ‘definitely disagree’). Respondents are instructed to select one
response per item. Items are scored dichotomously (i.e. collapsing ‘definitely agree’ and
‘slightly agree’ into ‘agree’ and similarly for ‘disagree’), with one point being assigned
for each response characteristic of ASD. Total AQ50 scores therefore range from 0 to 50,
with higher scores indicating more autistic traits. The published cut-off value for the
AQ10 is ⩾6, i.e. scores of 6 or above are considered positive for ASD (Allison et
al.
2012). For the AQ50, we compared two previously
described cut-offs: the ‘clinical’ threshold of ⩾32 and the ‘screening’ cut-off of ⩾26
(Baron-Cohen et al.
2001). All questionnaires were administered in
English.

Additionally, we investigated a novel variant of the AQ modified as an informant-rated
scale. This measure, which has not been previously validated, was introduced in the BGC
clinic to explore its potential as a non-self report measure of ASD symptoms and
difficulties. A family member or close friend of the participant completed the informant
AQ50. All of the questions were taken from the original AQ but re-worded to the
gender-neutral third person. For example, AQ50 item 1: ‘I prefer to do things with others
rather than on my own’ was changed to ‘S/he prefers to do things with others rather than
on his/her own’. The informant AQ10 was derived in the same way as the self-report
version. All questionnaires were administered in English.

Two formal ASD assessments are used in the BGC service: the ADOS-G (Lord et al.
2000) and the ADI-R (Lord et al.
1994). Experienced clinicians or clinical
research workers administered these assessments. A clinical expert judgement (diagnosis)
was made.

The ADOS-G is a measure of current ASD symptoms. The assessment comprises a structured
activity session and semi-structured interview that includes a series of social presses
and other opportunities intended to elicit behaviours associated with ASD. ADOS-G module
4, designed for verbally fluent adolescents and adults, was used.

The ADI-R is a parent/primary caregiver interview focused on developmental history of
ASD-specific behaviours. The ADI-R is a measure of early-life symptoms. Scores are
aggregated into symptom clusters that correspond to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV) criteria for a diagnosis of autism (Lord et
al.
1994).

Clinical diagnosis was made in a diagnostic meeting by consensus amongst a
multidisciplinary team, including consultant psychiatrists, psychologists, psychiatry
senior house officers (residents), specialist nurses and clinical research workers, using
International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 research criteria and informed by the
patient's ADOS-G and ADI-R scores. For this study, any autism-spectrum diagnosis was
considered ‘ASD’, including diagnoses of autism and Asperger's syndrome.

Reflecting clinical practice at the BGC service, the ADI-R was always performed first if
possible (i.e. if the parent or caregiver was alive and willing to be interviewed, and the
patient provided consent for us to speak with them). If the ADI-R could not be performed,
or if the outcome of the ADI-R was unclear, the ADOS-G was completed. Therefore some
patients received an ADI-R only, some received an ADOS-G only, and a minority received
both an ADI-R and an ADOS-G (these patients represented the more complex cases.)

A total of 476 adult patients were seen at the BGC clinic during the period of the study.
Self-rated AQ50 scores were available for 456 of these (96%) and AQ10 scores were
subsequently calculated for 428 (90%) (see online Supplementary Method). Of the patients,
473 (99%) received a clinical consensus expert diagnosis, 210 (44%) received an ADOS-G
assessment, 305 (64%) received an ADI-R, of which 40 received both ADOS-G and ADI-R. No
a priori sample size calculation was performed because these data were
originally collected for clinical purposes.

(co-morbidities), the BGC assessment procedures, data analysis and the treatment of
missing items, and inclusion and exclusion criteria, please see the online Supplementary

clinical data for research purposes, and the study was approved by the National Research
Ethics Service (NRES) Ethics Committee London – South East (ref: 12/LO/0790).

The sample of 476 adults included 355 males (75%) and 121 females (25%). Age ranged from
18 to 70 years, with a median age of 29 years. Of the participants, 115 (24%) were aged 21
years or younger. Of the patients, 346 (73%) were assigned a diagnosis of ASD by the
clinical team at the BGC (see Table 1).

[χ2 = 1.423, degrees of freedom (df) = 1, p = 0.233]. While
the test showed high sensitivity (0.77) as a predictor of receiving an ASD diagnosis, its
specificity was less good (0.29) (see Table 2).
The positive predictive value was high (0.76), indicating that three-quarters of those
scoring ⩾6 on the AQ10 did receive a clinical diagnosis of ASD. However, the low negative
predictive value (0.36) implies that nearly two-thirds of those who scored below the ⩾6
AQ10 cut-off, predicted not to receive an ASD diagnosis, in fact were diagnosed with ASD.
For a post-hoc power analysis of these comparisons, see the online
Supplementary Results.

We applied a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis to evaluate the
performance of the AQ10 with a range of cut-off criteria. The AQ10 did not significantly
predict clinical diagnosis by this criterion either [area under the curve (AUC) 0.55,
p = 0.12] (see online Supplementary Fig. S1).

Fig. 1 shows the distribution of AQ10 scores
according to ASD diagnosis status. There was no significant difference in mean AQ10 scores
between those diagnosed with ASD and those without ASD (ASD mean
7.26, s.d. = 2.28; not-ASD mean 6.85, s.d. = 2.46, t
test, p = 0.12), confirming that AQ10 scores are not predictive of
clinical diagnosis.

In a secondary analysis, we examined whether the original AQ50 questionnaire predicts ASD
caseness better than the brief AQ10 (see Table
2). Applying the ‘screening’ cut-off of ⩾26, the AQ50 performed significantly
better than chance (χ2 = 3.976, df = 1, p = 0.046). However,
its predictive power was modest, including high sensitivity (0.88) but very low
specificity (0.20). At the higher ‘clinical’ cut-off of AQ50 ⩾32, performance was no
better than chance (χ2 = 1.265, df = 1, p = 0.261).

The performance of the informant-report AQ50 and AQ10 was similar to that of the
self-report versions of the scale (see Table 2).
The AQ10 (χ2 = 3.658, df = 1, p = 0.056) and AQ50 cut-off ⩾26
(χ2 = 3.785, df = 1, p = 0.052) both predicted caseness
marginally better than chance. The AQ50 cut-off ⩾32 was significantly superior to chance
(χ2 = 8.860, df = 1, p = 0.003), but even here the
specificity was poor (0.38). In the ROC curve analysis of the informant-report AQ50 and
AQ10, these measures performed very similarly to the self-report versions. The informant
AQ50, though not the AQ10, predicted clinical diagnosis slightly better than chance (AUC
0.58, p = 0.017), similarly to the self-report AQ50 (where the AUC was
0.56). The best performance was with a cut-off of ⩾32 at which there was a sensitivity of
0.78 and a specificity of 0.38, and an accuracy of 67% (see online Supplementary Fig.
S2).

In order to address the question of whether AQ scores are predictive of the severity of
ASD symptoms as continuous variables, we examined Pearson product-moment correlations
between AQ scores and total scores on the ADOS-G and the ADI-R. ADOS-G totals were the sum
of the communication, social, and repetitive/restricted behaviours domains. ADI-R totals
were the sum of the communication, social, and repetitive domains. ADOS-G totals were not
correlated with either the self-report AQ10 or the AQ50 (all
p > 0.2). In contrast, ADI-R totals were correlated with the
self-report AQ10 (r = 0.12, p = 0.045) and the AQ50
(r = 0.13, p = 0.030), albeit weakly (see Table 3). These results show that self-reported ASD
traits, measured using the AQ, are not correlated with clinician-rated current ASD
behaviours (ADOS-G), but are weakly associated with retrospectively reported early-life
ASD symptoms (ADI-R). The correlation between ADOS-G and ADI-R scores was of trend
significance (r = 0.29, p = 0.072,
n = 40).

We obtained data on co-morbidities for 396 patients (84% of the sample). Across the whole
sample, major depressive disorder was present in 20% of cases, panic/agoraphobia 12%,
generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) 20%, social anxiety/phobia 17%,
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder 16%, and obsessive–compulsive disorder 20%.
Overall, 69% of patients were diagnosed with one or more co-morbidities (see Table 4). 

Rates of co-morbidities in true and false positives, and true and false negatives,
with caseness defined by ASD clinical diagnosis and screening prediction of ASD
defined as AQ10 self-report scores of ⩾6

ASD, Autism spectrum disorder; AQ10, 10-item Autism-Spectrum Quotient.

Compared with true negatives (who scored <6 on the AQ10 and did not receive a
clinical ASD diagnosis), false positives (<6 on the AQ10 but did receive a
diagnosis) were more likely to have GAD (21.1% v. 3.7%,
χ2 = 4.347, df = 1, p = 0.037). This suggests that GAD might
‘mimic’ ASD and lead to false positives on the AQ. In contrast, false negatives were less
likely to have at least one co-morbidity than true positives (61.0% v.
76.1%, χ2 = 5.241, df = 1, p = 0.022). This suggests that
individuals with ‘pure’ ASD, and no co-morbidities, might be more likely to be missed by
the AQ questionnaire. See Table 4 for
co-morbidity rates for each of the four groups (true positive, false positive, true
negative, and false negative).

To discover whether co-morbidities predict AQ scores independent of ASD caseness, we
performed a general linear model (GLM) analysis with AQ10 scores as the dependent
variable. Independent variables (fixed-effect factors) were: clinical ASD diagnosis, and
the six co-morbidities as binary predictors. The GLM revealed that GAD
(p = 0.014) was the only significant predictor of AQ10 scores, while ASD
diagnosis did not predict AQ10 scores (p = 0.537) in this analysis. See
online Supplementary Table S1 for the full GLM results. The AQ questionnaire therefore
seems to be more sensitive to the presence of GAD than it is to ASD in this sample. Those
individuals with ASD who present with no psychiatric co-morbidities may be at risk of
scoring below threshold on the AQ and thus becoming false negatives if the AQ is used as a
screening tool.

In order to put these results into a financial context, we estimated the financial
implications had the BGC clinic adopted the NICE guidelines suggesting that referrals for
ASD assessment should be made for a score of ⩾6 on the AQ10. This does not represent a
comprehensive health economics analysis, as we do not attempt to estimate the value of
receipt of an ASD diagnosis to an adult with ASD, or the cost to society of a case of
undiagnosed ASD.

In our sample of consecutive BGC patients spanning 4 years, 102 (24%) scored 5 or below
on the AQ10. Given that each BGC assessment costs the National Health Service (NHS) £2305
on average, according to a 2011 estimate (Murphy et al.
2011), this implies that a total of £ 235 110
(102 × £2305) could have been saved if all of these ‘AQ10 negative’ individuals had not
received a BGC referral, assuming that all other factors remained equal. However, 71 of
those 102 referrals went on to receive a clinical diagnosis of ASD at the BGC, that is,
70% of the ‘negatives’ proved to be false negatives. Therefore, for every 10 patients
denied a referral, £ 23 050 would have been saved but seven ASD cases would go
undiagnosed. For every £3300 (£ 235 000/71) saved, an individual with ASD would miss out
on a diagnosis.

Regarding the issue of false positives, of the 425 referrals, 323 (76%) scored 6 or above
on the AQ10 and would have been offered a referral under the NICE guidelines. However, of
these 323, 79 (24%) were diagnosed as not having an ASD at the clinical assessment. As
each assessment costs £2305, these false positives on the AQ10 would have cost the NHS £
182 095 (79 x £2305) over the 4 years of the study, or about £ 45 000 per year. Some of
these patients may have benefited from their BGC assessment despite not receiving an ASD
diagnosis, e.g. by receiving a diagnosis of another psychiatric disorder. However, 30 of
the 79 (38%) AQ10 ‘false positives’ were not assessed as having any psychiatric
disorder.

We investigated the AQ questionnaire as a predictor of ASD caseness in a large sample of
adults referred to our diagnostic clinic with suspected ASD. Our objective was to determine
if the AQ would be an effective means of ‘gating’ clinical referrals, as recommended by the
UK NICE guidelines (NICE, 2012). We found little
evidence that the AQ could predict who would receive a clinical diagnosis of ASD in our
sample. The brief AQ10 questionnaire was no better than chance as a predictor of ASD
diagnosis, providing high sensitivity (0.77) but low specificity (0.29). Nearly two-thirds
of the patients who scored below the cut-off score of 6 were ‘false negatives’, i.e. they
went on to receive a diagnosis of ASD. The longer version of the questionnaire, the AQ50,
performed only marginally better.

These results contrast with some prior findings. In two large studies (Allison et
al.
2012; Booth et al.
2013), the AQ10 was found to discriminate well
between ASD adults and healthy controls. However, Brugha et al. (2011b) found that it only modestly
predicted ASD caseness within a large general population sample. In that study, the AQ had a
sensitivity of 0.73 and a specificity of 0.62 when acting as a predictor of scoring above
the threshold of 10 points on the ADOS-G, and AQ scores were significantly, but weakly,
correlated with ADOS-G total symptoms (r = 0.24). In our sample we found a
comparable sensitivity, but a substantially lower specificity, and no significant
correlation between the ADOS-G and the AQ.

Why does the ability of the AQ to predict ASD diagnosis vary across studies? One plausible
explanation is differences in the nature of the non-ASD group. The AQ shows excellent
performance (Allison et al.
2012; Booth et al.
2013) in distinguishing ASD cases from healthy
controls recruited from the general population. However, such case–control studies are known
to overestimate the accuracy of diagnostic tests (Lijmer et al.
1999; Rutjes et al.
2006). Our study did not use a case–control design,
and our results suggest that the AQ differentiates poorly between true cases of ASD, and
individuals from the same clinical population who do not have ASD (Simonoff et al.
2008; Freeth et al.
2012; L Underwood et al.,
unpublished observations). Furthermore, we show that scores on the AQ were not correlated
with current ASD symptoms as measured with the ADOS-G. AQ scores did predict scores on the
ADI-R, a retrospective measure of childhood symptoms, but only weakly.

If the AQ, in its current form, is poorly predictive of ASD diagnosis in a clinical
setting, why is this? One possible explanation is that individuals with ASD lack insight
into their own behaviour (Bishop & Seltzer, 2012) and so find it difficult to self-report their own symptoms. However, against
this hypothesis, we found that even when an informant completed the AQ, scores only
marginally predicted clinical diagnosis, and did not correlate with ADOS-G symptoms. While
the informant AQ was more predictive of ADI-R scores, this may reflect the fact that the
ADI-R is itself an informant measure and the same informant completed both.

Therefore, a lack of self-insight may not fully account for the frequent discrepancies
between the AQ and other ASD measures. Co-morbidities may go some way to explain this issue.
We found that the presence of ASD is not an independent predictor of AQ10 scores but GAD
does predict higher AQ10 scores. Thus, GAD may contribute to false positives. We speculate
that the AQ may be sensitive to anxiety because several AQ items take the form of
self-evaluations, e.g. ‘I find it difficult to work out people's intentions’. Anxious
individuals commonly lack confidence in their social abilities (Mathews & MacLeod,
2005) and it is possible that this low
self-esteem might manifest as ASD-typical answers. Clinicians performing an ASD assessment,
however, are able to use their judgement to distinguish between ASD and other conditions
that can mimic ASD symptoms. We also showed that ASD individuals without co-morbidities
tended to score low on the AQ, perhaps putting them at risk of becoming ‘false negative’
cases, those who had ASD but scored <6 on the AQ10.

Our results have implications for both clinical services and for future research. From a
clinical perspective, we suggest that the adoption of the AQ as a clinical tool (as
recommended by NICE) (NICE, 2012) will need to be
guided by an assessment of the costs and benefits in relation to the particular patient
population in which its use is proposed. We have shown that, in a population with suspected
ASD seen at a national specialist diagnostic clinic, the sensitivity of the AQ is
acceptable, but the specificity is poor, and the overall performance is little better than
chance. As regards implications for future research, our findings highlight the need for
measures of ASD symptoms that are suitable for use in the population with suspected ASD. It
is possible that a subset of AQ50 items might be more effective than the AQ50 or the AQ10
subset that we examined. Alternatively, another ASD trait questionnaire might prove more
suitable, for instance the Autism Spectrum Disorders in Adults Screening Questionnaire
(ASDASQ) (Nylander & Gillberg, 2001).
Finally, a novel scale more predictive of ASD diagnosis might be developed through a study
of how clinicians discriminate ASD from ‘ASD-like’ symptoms.

Our study has a number of limitations. First, our study population was limited to one
clinic, the BGC, which is a national referral centre. It remains to be determined how well
our results would generalize to other clinical services. It is possible, for instance, that
the AQ might perform better in screening the referrals received by smaller local ASD
services, which receive a higher proportion of referrals from primary and secondary care.
Future research should explore this possibility. Next, a limitation of this retrospective
study was that we did not produce a published study protocol, and no a
priori power calculations were performed. This was a retrospective analysis, rather
than a prospective study designed to address a particular question. A further limitation is
that we did not obtain intelligence quotient (IQ) scores for our participants. IQ has been
shown to correlate with AQ scores (Bishop & Seltzer, 2012) but may be negatively associated with ADOS severity (Klin
et al.
2007); therefore it would have been desirable to
measure IQ as a potential confound. Similarly, while we had qualitative measures of
psychiatric co-morbidity, i.e. ICD-10 diagnoses, we lacked continuous measures of the
severity of these symptoms and so could not address these as confounds in a quantitative
manner. We calculated the AQ10 scores by summing the appropriate items from the AQ50, rather
than by administering the AQ10 as a questionnaire per se. It is possible
that our results would be different had we done so. A final limitation is that we only
examined the ADOS-G and ADI-R as ASD diagnostic tools, and did not evaluate other
instruments, such as the Diagnostic Interview for Social and Communication Disorders
schedule (Wing et al.
2002).

In conclusion, we report that the AQ did not predict ASD caseness in a large sample of
patients seen at an adult ASD diagnostic service. Therefore, the utility of the AQ for
triaging ASD referrals in those with suspected ASD is called into question. Being diagnosed
with ASD can represent a turning point for patients – and 85% of UK adults diagnosed with an
ASD were glad to receive the diagnosis (Jones et al.
2014). These results suggest that, in the diagnosis
of ASD, self-report questionnaire measures may not yet be able to substitute for specialist
clinical assessments.
