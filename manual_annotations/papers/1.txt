Maternal Race-Ethnicity, Immigrant Status, Country of Birth, and the Odds of a Child With Autism.

Abstract

The risk of autism spectrum disorder varies by maternal race–ethnicity, immigration status, and birth region. In this retrospective cohort study, Western Australian state registries and a study population of 134 204 mothers enabled us to examine the odds of autism spectrum disorder with intellectual disability in children born from 1994 to 2005 by the aforementioned characteristics. We adjusted for maternal age, parity, socioeconomic status, and birth year. Indigenous women were 50% less likely to have a child with autism spectrum disorder with intellectual disability than Caucasian, nonimmigrant women. Overall, immigrant women were 40% less likely to have a child with autism spectrum disorder with intellectual disability than nonimmigrant women. However, Black women from East Africa had more than 3.5 times the odds of autism spectrum disorder with intellectual disability in their children than Caucasian nonimmigrant women. Research is implicated on risk and protective factors for autism spectrum disorder with intellectual disability in the children of immigrant women.

We adjusted for maternal age, parity, socioeconomic status, and birth year. Indigenous women were 50% less likely to have a child with autism spectrum disorder with intellectual disability than Caucasian, nonimmigrant women. Overall, immigrant women were 40% less likely to have a child with autism spectrum disorder with intellectual disability than nonimmigrant women. However, Black women from East Africa had more than 3.5 times the odds of autism spectrum disorder with intellectual disability in their children than Caucasian nonimmigrant women. Research is implicated on risk and protective factors for autism spectrum disorder with intellectual disability in the children of immigrant women.

Autism spectrum disorder is a lifelong neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by deficits in social communication and interaction and by restricted and repetitive behaviors, interests, or activities. These deficits originate in early childhood and impact everyday functioning.1 About 30% to 50% of persons with autism spectrum disorder have comorbid intellectual disability,2,3 defined as having an IQ of less than 70 and impairments in adaptive functioning occurring before age 18 years.1


In some countries, the prevalence of diagnosed autism spectrum disorder is lower among children of women from minority ethnic groups. For example, children of Indigenous women in Australia4 and Canada5 have a lower prevalence of diagnosed autism spectrum disorder than the children of Caucasian women. In the United States, children born to Hispanic and Black women have lower prevalence of diagnosed autism spectrum disorder than children born to Caucasian women.3 Additionally, some studies indicate the proportionate distribution of autism spectrum disorder with (vs without) intellectual disability is higher in the children of Hispanic, Asian, or Black women than the children of Caucasian women.6–8 Other studies4,9–14 have suggested that the prevalence of autism spectrum disorder, and especially autism spectrum disorder with intellectual disability,4,13 is higher among the children of immigrant than nonimmigrant women. In contrast, a United States population-based study reported that children born to immigrant Hispanic women had significantly lower rates of diagnosed autism spectrum disorder than children of nonimmigrant Hispanic or Caucasian women.15


Currently, it is not clear whether the association between maternal immigration status and the risk of having a child with autism spectrum disorder is primarily related to maternal race–ethnicity, immigrant status, or associated factors, such as the region of birth, the income status of the mother’s native country, the distance from the native country,16 maternal stress,17,18 nutrition,19 or other exposures of the mother. Although most studies have not separately examined race–ethnicity and immigration status, a few studies have shown that the prevalence of autism spectrum disorder among immigrant women can vary according to race–ethnicity and region of birth. For example, children born in Sweden16 and the United States20 to Black women from East Africa had higher rates of autism spectrum disorder with intellectual disability compared to children of native-born women. Likewise, children born in Western Australia and Malmö Sweden whose mothers were born in East Asia4 had higher autism spectrum disorder prevalence rates than children born in the same countries to nonimmigrant women.21


The estimated prevalence of autism spectrum disorder is increasing,22–24 and in Australia and other Western countries, the rate of immigration is also increasing. In Australia, the immigrant racial–ethnic composition25,26 is changing over time, and so year of birth should be considered in the analyses of prevalence differences according to race–ethnicity/immigration status.10,11,13,14 Therefore, while controlling for birth-year group and other demographic factors, we compared the prevalence of autism spectrum disorder with and without intellectual disability among children in Western Australia within subgroups defined by:




Apart from providing insight into risk factors for autism spectrum disorder, differences in the prevalence of autism spectrum disorder among racial–ethnic groups might point to differences in ascertainment and thereby identify the need for enhanced screening in some population subgroups.
Study Population and Data Collection

Our study population consisted of all women with a live-born child in Western Australia between 1994 and 2005 (inclusive). Our data were extracted from the Midwives Notification System,27 which provided birth dates, data to inform measures of maternal race–ethnicity, parity and socioeconomic status, and the Western Australia Birth Register27 which provided us with the maternal country of birth. Our third data source was the Intellectual Disability Exploring Answers Database28 which receives diagnostic information on children with autism spectrum disorder or intellectual disability from the state government organization, the Disability Services Commission,29 and the Western Australia Department of Education. Diagnoses of autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability were made by clinicians or psychologists using criteria from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition) and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition, Text Revision). The Intellectual Disability Exploring Answers Database provided records of children born between 1994 and 2005 (inclusive) and diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder, with and without intellectual disability, before 2011. An IQ test was performed in all cases unless the child obviously did not have intellectual disability or the child was unable to be assessed. For children within the latter group, an estimate was made on whether the child was vulnerable to intellectual disability. Linkage of the aforementioned data sets was enabled by the use of an encrypted alphanumeric code, which was created for each mother by personnel from Western Australia’s Data Linkage Branch.27

Maternal Groups

For women with at least one child identified with autism spectrum disorder, the index child was the eldest child with autism spectrum disorder born during the study period. Women in all comparison groups had no child identified with autism spectrum disorder, and the index child was the first-born child during the collection period. Case mothers were grouped into the case groups, autism spectrum disorder with intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder without intellectual disability, according to the disability of their index child.
Explanatory Variables

Researchers have previously demonstrated that socioeconomic status, maternal age, and parity are associated with autism spectrum disorder.4 The prevalence of autism spectrum disorder30 and the pattern of immigration to Western Australia from different regions25 have varied over time. Consequently, we included a binary measure of grouped birth year of the index child with the groups of 1994 to 1999 and 2000 to 2005. We derived our measure of maternal socioeconomic status from an Index of Relative Socioeconomic Disadvantage
31 and quartile boundaries from the original data set to define “low” pertaining to the lowest quartile, “medium” to the two inner quartiles, and “high” to the top quartile. We calculated maternal age at the index birth and defined a variable with the levels of 20 to 30 years, 31 to 40 years, and >40 years. Parity at the index birth was defined by 0 previous children, 1 previous child, 2 to 3 previous children, and >3 previous children. We did not include births after 2005, as a five-year period was needed for children with autism spectrum disorder without intellectual disability to have the opportunity to be diagnosed.
Variables Defining Maternal Groups



We classified maternal race–ethnicity as Caucasian, Asian, Black, Indian, Maori or Polynesian, and Indigenous (Figure 1). In this article, Asian describes women identified as being of Asian race–ethnicity and not women from Asia who can be of other race–ethnicities as well. The Indigenous group included all women who self-identified as an Australian Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander.

Comparison groups assessed in analyses according to race–ethnicity, independent of immigration status.



A binary variable indicated maternal immigration status. Women who were born in an Australian state or mainland territory were categorized as nonimmigrant and all others as immigrant. We further divided the remainder of the world into the six regions of Central Asia, South Asia, Other Asia, East Africa, Other Africa, and Other regions. We chose these regions because we wanted to explore the odds of having a child identified with autism spectrum disorder in women of Asian race–ethnicity from Central Asia and South Asia and in Black women from East Africa, as other researchers had noted higher odds of autism spectrum disorder in children of women from these regions (Supplementary Table 1). We also grouped Asian and Black immigrant women according to their birth region (Figure 2).

Analyses

We used multinomial logistic regression where the dependent variable was the autism spectrum disorder case group. As stated earlier, both autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability are based on a child receiving a diagnosis. The independent variables were one or more of maternal race–ethnicity, immigration status, and region of birth. We included covariates for maternal age, parity, socioeconomic status, and index birth year in the final model and report the unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios. We did not assess maternal groups with less than six observations due to the unreliability of these results.32 In case groups of size from six to nine, we calculated only the unadjusted odds ratios (or relative prevalence odds), as these groups were too small for the calculation of meaningful adjusted odds ratios.33 Since socioeconomic status is positively correlated with the prevalence of diagnosed autism spectrum disorder,4 we examined socioeconomic status in case groups where small numbers prevented us from calculating adjusted odds ratios. We tested the distribution of socioeconomic status in each of these groups compared to the comparator group using a χ2 test. In addition, we also tested proportions relating the demographic characteristics of parity and age to maternal groups using a χ2 test.

Race–Ethnicity

The odds of having a child identified with autism spectrum disorder with intellectual disability were similar among women of Asian race–ethnicity and Caucasian women, unadjusted odds ratio 1.09 (95% confidence interval: 0.8-1.4); adjustment for demographic factors reduced the odds ratio slightly, 0.77 (95% confidence interval: 0.6-1.02). Black women were about 50% more likely to have a child diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder with intellectual disability than Caucasian women, although the difference was not statistically significant, odds ratio = 1.48 (0.7-3.1). For Indigenous women, the odds of having a child diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder with intellectual disability were about half the odds for Caucasian women both before, odds ratio = 0.54 (95% confidence interval: 0.4-0.8), and after adjustment, adjusted odds ratio = 0.52 (95% confidence interval: 0.3-0.8; Table 3).

Immigrant Status

After adjustment for demographic factors and compared to nonimmigrant women, immigrant women were less likely to have a child diagnosed with either autism spectrum disorder with intellectual disability or autism spectrum disorder without intellectual disability, adjusted odds ratios 0.64 (95% confidence interval: 0.6-0.7) and 0.62 (95% confidence interval: 0.5-0.8), respectively.
Groups of Special Interest

Overall, the children of immigrant women from other Asia had a lower prevalence of diagnosed autism spectrum disorder with intellectual disability (P = .46), and the children of immigrant women from East Africa had a higher prevalence of diagnosed autism spectrum disorder with intellectual disability than the referent group (children of Caucasian, nonimmigrant women; Table 4), although neither differences were significant. Prior to adjustment and compared to Caucasian nonimmigrant women, women of Asian race–ethnicity from Central Asia and from South Asia each had about a 30% increased odds of having a child diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder with intellectual disability, odds ratios 1.28 (95% confidence interval: 0.8-2.0) and 1.37 (95% confidence interval: 0.9-2.0), respectively (Table 5). After adjustment for demographic factors, these odds ratios were reduced, adjusted odds ratios 0.83 (95% confidence interval: 0.5-1.3) and 0.83 (95% confidence interval: 0.6-1.2), respectively. Women of Asian race–ethnicity from other parts of Asia had less than half the odds of having a child identified with autism spectrum disorder with intellectual disability, odds ratio 0.44 (95% confidence interval: 0.2-0.98), P < .05; due to small case numbers (N < 10), we did not perform adjusted analyses for this group. Black women from East Africa had more than three-fold higher odds of having a child identified with autism spectrum disorder with intellectual disability, odds ratio 3.57 (1.7-7.6), P < .005; small case numbers also precluded adjusted analyses for this group. Indigenous women had about half the odds of having a child with autism spectrum disorder with intellectual disability, adjusted odds ratio 0.51 (0.3-0.8), P < .005.

Strength and Limitations

Our study was enabled by the availability of population-based data on children with autism spectrum disorder or intellectual disability. Important variables, such as race–ethnicity and birth dates, were collected by midwives in conjunction with the mothers, and immigration status was provided by the Birth Registry. This reduced bias and enhanced the accuracy of our results. Another strength is our separation of Asian race–ethnicity from the trait of being born in Asia.

Nonetheless, one study limitation is the likelihood of some incorrect categorizations of ethnicity. Moreover, the numbers of mothers of some ethnicities were small. This, combined with the small number of children with autism spectrum disorder, limited the groups available for analysis. The number of children with a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder without intellectual disability was especially small; it is very likely that this group is incomplete, since younger children might not yet have been assessed for either autism spectrum disorder or intellectual disability and those children with milder symptoms of autism spectrum disorder without intellectual disability might not be recognized as such before they have entered school. This greatly limited our ability to assess autism spectrum disorder without intellectual disability. Overall, only 25% of children identified as having autism spectrum disorder were classified as autism spectrum disorder without intellectual disability, and the proportion among non-Caucasian groups was markedly lower.

Conclusion

Our comprehensive assessment of the Western Australia population revealed three groups of children whose prevalence of diagnosed autism spectrum disorder , particularly autism spectrum disorder with intellectual disability, diverged from the referent group—Caucasian children with nonimmigrant Caucasian mothers. Children born to Indigenous women had significantly lower prevalence of diagnosed autism spectrum disorder than the referent group, possibly associated with low socioeconomic status and poor access to diagnostic services. Children of women of Asian race–ethnicity who migrated from parts of other Asia also had significantly lower prevalence of diagnosed autism spectrum disorder; however, the underlying reason is likely different from that for children born to Indigenous women. These Asian immigrant women were of higher than average socioeconomic status, suggesting the possibility of a healthy immigrant effect. Finally, the high prevalence of diagnosed autism spectrum disorder in children born to Black women from East Africa is in line with a few other small studies. However, neither our study nor previous studies could explore the possible underlying reasons. We hypothesize that at least some of this difference could be the result of various factors leading to higher ascertainment of autism spectrum disorder in this group of children; however, we cannot rule out the possibility of some biological risk factor, such as nutrition or stress. Further study is needed to disentangle possible ascertainment versus biologic reasons for the disparities we observed. Such study will present challenges, given the need to aggregate data across many years and possibly combine data from multiple locations in order to have sufficient numbers to study children within immigrant subgroups. Nonetheless, in light of the improved outcomes of early intervention,46 improved methods of ascertainment and access to services, particularly for Indigenous children, are indicated.

Supplementary Material

The risk of autism spectrum disorder varies by maternal race–ethnicity, immigration status, and birth region. In this retrospective cohort study, Western Australian state registries and a study population of 134 204 mothers enabled us to examine the odds of autism spectrum disorder with intellectual disability in children born from 1994 to 2005 by the aforementioned characteristics. We adjusted for maternal age, parity, socioeconomic status, and birth year. Indigenous women were 50% less likely to have a child with autism spectrum disorder with intellectual disability than Caucasian, nonimmigrant women. Overall, immigrant women were 40% less likely to have a child with autism spectrum disorder with intellectual disability than nonimmigrant women. However, Black women from East Africa had more than 3.5 times the odds of autism spectrum disorder with intellectual disability in their children than Caucasian nonimmigrant women. Research is implicated on risk and protective factors for autism spectrum disorder with intellectual disability in the children of immigrant women.

Autism spectrum disorder is a lifelong neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by deficits in social communication and interaction and by restricted and repetitive behaviors, interests, or activities. These deficits originate in early childhood and impact everyday functioning.1 About 30% to 50% of persons with autism spectrum disorder have comorbid intellectual disability,2,3 defined as having an IQ of less than 70 and impairments in adaptive functioning occurring before age 18 years.1


In some countries, the prevalence of diagnosed autism spectrum disorder is lower among children of women from minority ethnic groups. For example, children of Indigenous women in Australia4 and Canada5 have a lower prevalence of diagnosed autism spectrum disorder than the children of Caucasian women. In the United States, children born to Hispanic and Black women have lower prevalence of diagnosed autism spectrum disorder than children born to Caucasian women.3 Additionally, some studies indicate the proportionate distribution of autism spectrum disorder with (vs without) intellectual disability is higher in the children of Hispanic, Asian, or Black women than the children of Caucasian women.6–8 Other studies4,9–14 have suggested that the prevalence of autism spectrum disorder, and especially autism spectrum disorder with intellectual disability,4,13 is higher among the children of immigrant than nonimmigrant women. In contrast, a United States population-based study reported that children born to immigrant Hispanic women had significantly lower rates of diagnosed autism spectrum disorder than children of nonimmigrant Hispanic or Caucasian women.15


Currently, it is not clear whether the association between maternal immigration status and the risk of having a child with autism spectrum disorder is primarily related to maternal race–ethnicity, immigrant status, or associated factors, such as the region of birth, the income status of the mother’s native country, the distance from the native country,16 maternal stress,17,18 nutrition,19 or other exposures of the mother. Although most studies have not separately examined race–ethnicity and immigration status, a few studies have shown that the prevalence of autism spectrum disorder among immigrant women can vary according to race–ethnicity and region of birth. For example, children born in Sweden16 and the United States20 to Black women from East Africa had higher rates of autism spectrum disorder with intellectual disability compared to children of native-born women. Likewise, children born in Western Australia and Malmö Sweden whose mothers were born in East Asia4 had higher autism spectrum disorder prevalence rates than children born in the same countries to nonimmigrant women.21


The estimated prevalence of autism spectrum disorder is increasing,22–24 and in Australia and other Western countries, the rate of immigration is also increasing. In Australia, the immigrant racial–ethnic composition25,26 is changing over time, and so year of birth should be considered in the analyses of prevalence differences according to race–ethnicity/immigration status.10,11,13,14 Therefore, while controlling for birth-year group and other demographic factors, we compared the prevalence of autism spectrum disorder with and without intellectual disability among children in Western Australia within subgroups defined by:




Apart from providing insight into risk factors for autism spectrum disorder, differences in the prevalence of autism spectrum disorder among racial–ethnic groups might point to differences in ascertainment and thereby identify the need for enhanced screening in some population subgroups.

Our study population consisted of all women with a live-born child in Western Australia between 1994 and 2005 (inclusive). Our data were extracted from the Midwives Notification System,27 which provided birth dates, data to inform measures of maternal race–ethnicity, parity and socioeconomic status, and the Western Australia Birth Register27 which provided us with the maternal country of birth. Our third data source was the Intellectual Disability Exploring Answers Database28 which receives diagnostic information on children with autism spectrum disorder or intellectual disability from the state government organization, the Disability Services Commission,29 and the Western Australia Department of Education. Diagnoses of autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability were made by clinicians or psychologists using criteria from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition) and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition, Text Revision). The Intellectual Disability Exploring Answers Database provided records of children born between 1994 and 2005 (inclusive) and diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder, with and without intellectual disability, before 2011. An IQ test was performed in all cases unless the child obviously did not have intellectual disability or the child was unable to be assessed. For children within the latter group, an estimate was made on whether the child was vulnerable to intellectual disability. Linkage of the aforementioned data sets was enabled by the use of an encrypted alphanumeric code, which was created for each mother by personnel from Western Australia’s Data Linkage Branch.27


For women with at least one child identified with autism spectrum disorder, the index child was the eldest child with autism spectrum disorder born during the study period. Women in all comparison groups had no child identified with autism spectrum disorder, and the index child was the first-born child during the collection period. Case mothers were grouped into the case groups, autism spectrum disorder with intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder without intellectual disability, according to the disability of their index child.

Researchers have previously demonstrated that socioeconomic status, maternal age, and parity are associated with autism spectrum disorder.4 The prevalence of autism spectrum disorder30 and the pattern of immigration to Western Australia from different regions25 have varied over time. Consequently, we included a binary measure of grouped birth year of the index child with the groups of 1994 to 1999 and 2000 to 2005. We derived our measure of maternal socioeconomic status from an Index of Relative Socioeconomic Disadvantage
31 and quartile boundaries from the original data set to define “low” pertaining to the lowest quartile, “medium” to the two inner quartiles, and “high” to the top quartile. We calculated maternal age at the index birth and defined a variable with the levels of 20 to 30 years, 31 to 40 years, and >40 years. Parity at the index birth was defined by 0 previous children, 1 previous child, 2 to 3 previous children, and >3 previous children. We did not include births after 2005, as a five-year period was needed for children with autism spectrum disorder without intellectual disability to have the opportunity to be diagnosed.

The risk of autism spectrum disorder varies by maternal race–ethnicity, immigration status, and birth region. In this retrospective cohort study, Western Australian state registries and a study population of 134 204 mothers enabled us to examine the odds of autism spectrum disorder with intellectual disability in children born from 1994 to 2005 by the aforementioned characteristics. We adjusted for maternal age, parity, socioeconomic status, and birth year. Indigenous women were 50% less likely to have a child with autism spectrum disorder with intellectual disability than Caucasian, nonimmigrant women. Overall, immigrant women were 40% less likely to have a child with autism spectrum disorder with intellectual disability than nonimmigrant women. However, Black women from East Africa had more than 3.5 times the odds of autism spectrum disorder with intellectual disability in their children than Caucasian nonimmigrant women. Research is implicated on risk and protective factors for autism spectrum disorder with intellectual disability in the children of immigrant women.

Autism spectrum disorder is a lifelong neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by deficits in social communication and interaction and by restricted and repetitive behaviors, interests, or activities. These deficits originate in early childhood and impact everyday functioning.1 About 30% to 50% of persons with autism spectrum disorder have comorbid intellectual disability,2,3 defined as having an IQ of less than 70 and impairments in adaptive functioning occurring before age 18 years.1


In some countries, the prevalence of diagnosed autism spectrum disorder is lower among children of women from minority ethnic groups.
