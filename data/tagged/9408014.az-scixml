<ABSTRACT>
<A-S ID='A-0' AZ='AIM'> This paper compares a qualitative reasoning model of translation with a quantitative statistical model . </A-S>
<A-S ID='A-1' AZ='OWN'> We consider these models within the context of two hypothetical speech translation systems , starting with a logic-based design and pointing out which of its characteristics are best preserved or eliminated in moving to the second , quantitative design . </A-S>
<A-S ID='A-2' AZ='OWN'> The quantitative language and translation models are based on relations between lexical heads of phrases . </A-S>
<A-S ID='A-3' AZ='OWN'> Statistical parameters for structural dependency , lexical transfer , and linear order are used to select a set of implicit relations between words in a source utterance , a corresponding set of relations between target language words , and the most likely translation of the original utterance . </A-S>

<HEADER ID='H-0'> Introduction </HEADER>
<P>
<S ID='S-0' AZ='BKG'> In recent years there has been a resurgence of interest in statistical approaches to natural language processing . </S>
<S ID='S-1' AZ='BKG'> Such approaches are not new , witness the statistical approach to machine translation suggested by <REF TYPE='A'>Weaver 1955</REF> , but the current level of interest is largely due to the success of applying hidden Markov models and N-gram language models in speech recognition . </S>
<S ID='S-2' AZ='BKG'> This success was directly measurable in terms of word recognition error rates , prompting language processing researchers to seek corresponding improvements in performance and robustness . </S>
<S ID='S-3' AZ='BKG'> A speech translation system , which by necessity combines speech and language technology , is a natural place to consider combining the statistical and conventional approaches and much of this paper describes probabilistic models of structural language analysis and translation . </S>
<S ID='S-4' AZ='AIM'> Our aim will be to provide an overall model for translation with the best of both worlds . </S>
<S ID='S-5' AZ='OWN'> Various factors will lead us to conclude that a lexicalist statistical model with dependency relations is well suited to this goal . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-6' AZ='OWN'> As well as this quantitative approach , we will consider a constraint / logic based approach and try to distinguish characteristics that we wish to preserve from those that are best replaced by statistical models . </S>
<S ID='S-7' AZ='OWN'> Although perhaps implicit in many conventional approaches to translation , a characterization in logical terms of what is being done is rarely given , so we will attempt to make that explicit here , more or less from first principles . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-8' AZ='TXT'> Before proceeding , I will first examine some fashionable distinctions in section <CREF/> in order to clarify the issues involved in comparing these approaches . </S>
<S ID='S-9' AZ='TXT'> I will attempt to argue that the important distinction is not so much a rational-empirical or symbolic-statistical distinction but rather a qualitative-quantitative one . </S>
<S ID='S-10' AZ='TXT'> This is followed by discussion of the logic-based model in section <CREF/> , the overall quantitative model in section <CREF/> , monolingual models in section <CREF/> , translation models in section <CREF/> , and some conclusions in section <CREF/> . </S>
<S ID='S-11' AZ='OWN'> We concentrate throughout on what information about language and translation is coded and how it is expressed as logical constraints or statistical parameters . </S>
<S ID='S-12' AZ='OWN'> Although important , we will say little about search algorithms , rule acquisition , or parameter estimation . </S>

<HEADER ID='H-1'> Qualitative and Quantitative Models </HEADER>
<P>
<S ID='S-13' AZ='BKG'> One contrast often taken for granted is the identification of a ` statistical-symbolic ' distinction in language processing as an instance of the empirical vs. rational debate . </S>
<S ID='S-14' AZ='OWN'> I believe this contrast has been exaggerated though historically it has had some validity in terms of accepted practice . </S>
<S ID='S-15' AZ='BKG'> Rule based approaches have become more empirical in a number of ways : </S>
<S ID='S-16' AZ='BKG'> First , a more empirical approach is being adopted to grammar development whereby the rule set is modified according to its performance against corpora of natural text <REF TYPE='P'>Taylor et al. 1989</REF> . </S>
<S ID='S-17' AZ='BKG'> Second , there is a class of techniques for learning rules from text , a recent example being <REF TYPE='A'>Brill 1993</REF> . </S>
<S ID='S-18' AZ='BKG'> Conversely , it is possible to imagine building a language model in which all probabilities are estimated according to intuition without reference to any real data , giving a probabilistic model that is not empirical . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-19' AZ='BKG'> Most language processing labeled as statistical involves associating real-number valued parameters to configurations of symbols . </S>
<S ID='S-20' AZ='BKG'> This is not surprising given that natural language , at least in written form , is explicitly symbolic . </S>
<S ID='S-21' AZ='BKG'> Presumably , classifying a system as symbolic must refer to a different set of ( internal ) symbols , but even this does not rule out many statistical systems modeling events involving nonterminal categories and word senses . </S>
<S ID='S-22' AZ='OWN'> Given that the notion of a symbol , let alone an ` internal symbol ' , is itself a slippery one , it may be unwise to build our theories of language , or even the way we classify different theories , on this notion . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-23' AZ='BKG'> Instead , it would seem that the real contrast driving the shift towards statistics in language processing is a contrast between qualitative systems dealing exclusively with combinatoric constraints , and quantitative systems that involve computing numerical functions . </S>
<S ID='S-24' AZ='BKG'> This bears directly on the problems of brittleness and complexity that discrete approaches to language processing share with , for example , reasoning systems based on traditional logical inference . </S>
<S ID='S-25' AZ='CTR'> It relates to the inadequacy of the dominant theories in linguistics to capture ` shades ' of meaning or degrees of acceptability which are often recognized by people outside the field as important inherent properties of natural language . </S>
<S ID='S-26' AZ='OTH'> The qualitative-quantitative distinction can also be seen as underlying the difference between classification systems based on feature specifications , as used in unification formalisms <REF TYPE='P'>Shieber 1986</REF> , and clustering based on a variable degree of granularity <REF TYPE='P'>Pereira et al. 1993</REF> . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-27' AZ='OWN'> It seems unlikely that these continuously variable aspects of fluent natural language can be captured by a purely combinatoric model . </S>
<S ID='S-28' AZ='OWN'> This naturally leads to the question of how best to introduce quantitative modeling into language processing . </S>
<S ID='S-29' AZ='OWN'> It is not , of course , necessary for the quantities of a quantitative model to be probabilities . </S>
<S ID='S-30' AZ='OWN'> For example , we may wish to define real-valued functions on parse trees that reflect the extent to which the trees conform to , say , minimal attachment and parallelism between conjuncts . </S>
<S ID='S-31' AZ='OTH'> Such functions have been used in tandem with statistical functions in experiments on disambiguation <REF TYPE='P' SELF="YES">Alshawi and Carter 1994</REF> . </S>
<S ID='S-32' AZ='OWN'> Another example is connection strengths in neural network approaches to language processing , though it has been shown that certain networks are effectively computing probabilities <REF TYPE='P'>Richard and Lippmann 1991</REF> . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-33' AZ='BKG'> Nevertheless , probability theory does offer a coherent and relatively well understood framework for selecting between uncertain alternatives , making it a natural choice for quantitative language processing . </S>
<S ID='S-34' AZ='BKG'> The case for probability theory is strengthened by a well developed empirical methodology in the form of statistical parameter estimation . </S>
<S ID='S-35' AZ='BKG'> There is also the strong connection between probability theory and the formal theory of information and communication , a connection that has been exploited in speech recognition , for example using the concept of entropy to provide a motivated way of measuring the complexity of a recognition problem <REF TYPE='P'>Jelinek et al. 1992</REF> . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-36' AZ='BKG'> Even if probability theory remains , as it currently is , the method of choice in making language processing quantitative , this still leaves the field wide open in terms of carving up language processing into an appropriate set of events for probability theory to work with . </S>
<S ID='S-37' AZ='OTH'> For translation , a very direct approach using parameters based on surface positions of words in source and target sentences was adopted in the Candide system <REF TYPE='P'>Brown et al. 1990</REF> . </S>
<S ID='S-38' AZ='CTR'> However , this does not capture important structural properties of natural language . </S>
<S ID='S-39' AZ='CTR'> Nor does it take into account generalizations about translation that are independent of the exact word order in source and target sentences . </S>
<S ID='S-40' AZ='BKG'> Such generalizations are , of course , central to qualitative structural approaches to translation <REF TYPE='P'>Isabelle and Macklovitch 1986</REF> , <REF TYPE='P' SELF="YES">Alshawi et al. 1992</REF> . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-41' AZ='AIM'> The aim of the quantitative language and translation models presented in sections <CREF/> and <CREF/> is to employ probabilistic parameters that reflect linguistic structure without discarding rich lexical information or making the models too complex to train automatically . </S>
<S ID='S-42' AZ='OWN'> In terms of a traditional classification , this would be seen as a ` hybrid symbolic-statistical ' system because it deals with linguistic structure . </S>
<S ID='S-43' AZ='OWN'> From our perspective , it can be seen as a quantitative version of the logic-based model because both models attempt to capture similar information ( about the organization of words into phrases and relations holding between these phrases or their referents ) , though the tools of modeling are substantially different . </S>

<HEADER ID='H-2'> Dissecting a Logic-Based System </HEADER>
<P>
<S ID='S-44' AZ='OWN'> We now consider a hypothetical speech translation system in which the language processing components follow a conventional qualitative transfer design . </S>
<S ID='S-45' AZ='BAS'> Although hypothetical , this design and its components are similar to those used in existing database query <REF TYPE='P' SELF="YES">Rayner and Alshawi 1992</REF> and translation systems <REF SELF="YES" TYPE='P'>Alshawi et al. 1992</REF> . </S>
<S ID='S-46' AZ='OWN'> More recent versions of these systems have been gradually taking on a more quantitative flavor , particularly with respect to choosing between alternative analyses , but our hypothetical system will be more purist in its qualitative approach . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-47' AZ='OWN'> The overall design is as follows . </S>
<S ID='S-48' AZ='OWN'> We assume that a speech recognition subsystem delivers a list of text strings corresponding to transcriptions of an input utterance . </S>
<S ID='S-49' AZ='OWN'> These recognition hypotheses are passed to a parser which applies a logic-based grammar and lexicon to produce a set of logical forms , specifically formulas in first order logic corresponding to possible interpretations of the utterance . </S>
<S ID='S-50' AZ='OWN'> The logical forms are filtered by contextual and word-sense constraints , and one of them is passed to the translation component . </S>
<S ID='S-51' AZ='OWN'> The translation relation is expressed by a set of first order axioms which are used by a theorem prover to derive a target language logical form that is equivalent ( in some context ) to the source logical form . </S>
<S ID='S-52' AZ='OWN'> A grammar for the target language is then applied to the target form , generating a syntax tree whose fringe is passed to a speech synthesizer . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-53' AZ='OWN'> Taking the various components in turn , we make a note of undesirable properties that might be improved by quantitative modeling . </S>
</P>
<DIV DEPTH='2'>
<HEADER ID='H-3'> Analysis and Generation </HEADER>
<P>
<S ID='S-54' AZ='OWN'> A grammar , expressed as a set of syntactic rules ( axioms ) <EQN/> and a set of semantic rules ( axioms ) <EQN/> is used to support a relation form holding between strings s and logical forms <EQN/> expressed in first order logic : </S>
</P>
<IMAGE ID='I-0'/>
<P>
<S ID='S-55' AZ='OWN'> The relation form is many-to-many , associating a string with linguistically possible logical form interpretations . </S>
<S ID='S-56' AZ='OWN'> In the analysis direction , we are given s and search for logical forms <EQN/> , while in generation we search for strings s given <EQN/> . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-57' AZ='OWN'> For analysis and generation , we are treating strings s and logical forms <EQN/> as object level entities . </S>
<S ID='S-58' AZ='OWN'> In interpretation and translation , we will move down from this meta-level reasoning to reasoning with the logical forms as propositions . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-59' AZ='OWN'> The list of text strings handed by the recognizer to the parser can be assumed to be ordered in accordance with some acoustic scoring scheme internal to the recognizer . </S>
<S ID='S-60' AZ='OWN'> The magnitude of the scores is ignored by our qualitative language processor ; it simply processes the hypotheses one at a time until it finds one for which it can produce a complete logical form interpretation that passes grammatical and interpretation constraints , at which point it discards the remaining hypotheses . </S>
<S ID='S-61' AZ='OWN'> Clearly , discarding the acoustic score and taking the first hypothesis that satisfies the constraints may lead to an interpretation that is less plausible than one derivable from a hypothesis further down in the recognition list . </S>
<S ID='S-62' AZ='OWN'> But there is no point in processing these later hypotheses since we will be forced to select one interpretation essentially at random . </S>
</P>
<DIV DEPTH='3'>
<HEADER ID='H-4'> Syntax </HEADER>
<P>
<S ID='S-63' AZ='OWN'> The syntactic rules in <EQN/> relate ` category ' predicates <EQN/> holding of a string and two spanning substrings ( we limit the rules here to two daughters for simplicity ) : </S>
</P>
<IMAGE ID='I-1'/>
<P>
<S ID='S-64' AZ='OWN'> ( Here , and subsequently , variables like <EQN/> and <EQN/> are implicitly universally quantified . )</S>
<S ID='S-65' AZ='OWN'> <EQN/> also includes lexical axioms for particular strings w consisting of single words : </S>
<S ID='S-66' AZ='OWN'> <EQN/> , ... <EQN/> </S>
<S ID='S-67' AZ='OWN'> For a feature-based grammar , these rules can include conjuncts constraining the values , <EQN/> , of discrete-valued functions f on the strings : </S>
</P>
<IMAGE ID='I-2'/>
<P>
<S ID='S-68' AZ='OWN'> The main problem here is that such grammars have no notion of a degree of grammatical acceptability - a sentence is either grammatical or ungrammatical . </S>
<S ID='S-69' AZ='OWN'> For small grammars this means that perfectly acceptable strings are often rejected ; for large grammars we get a vast number of alternative trees so the chance of selecting the correct tree for simple sentences can get worse as the grammar coverage increases . </S>
<S ID='S-70' AZ='OWN'> There is also the problem of requiring increasingly complex feature sets to describe idiosyncrasies in the lexicon . </S>
</P>
</DIV>
<DIV DEPTH='3'>
<HEADER ID='H-5'> Semantics </HEADER>
<P>
<S ID='S-71' AZ='OWN'> Semantic grammar axioms belonging to <EQN/> specify a ` composition ' function g for deriving a logical form for a phrase from those for its subphrases : </S>
</P>
<IMAGE ID='I-3'/>
<P>
<S ID='S-72' AZ='OWN'> The interpretation rules for strings bottom out in a set of lexical semantic rules associating words with predicates ( <EQN/> ) corresponding to ` word senses ' . </S>
<S ID='S-73' AZ='OWN'> For a particular word and syntactic category , there will be a ( small , possibly empty ) finite set of such word sense predicates : </S>
</P>
<IMAGE ID='I-4'/>
<P>
<S ID='S-74' AZ='OWN'> First order logic was assumed as the semantic representation language because it comes with well understood , if not very practical , inferential machinery for constraint solving . </S>
<S ID='S-75' AZ='OWN'> However , applying this machinery requires making logical forms fine grained to a degree often not warranted by the information the speaker of an utterance intended to convey . </S>
<S ID='S-76' AZ='OWN'> An example of this is explicit scoping which leads ( again ) to large numbers of alternatives which the qualitative model has difficulty choosing between . </S>
<S ID='S-77' AZ='OWN'> Also , many natural language sentences cannot be expressed in first order logic without resort to elaborate formulas requiring complex semantic composition rules . </S>
<S ID='S-78' AZ='OWN'> These rules can be simplified by using a higher order logic but at the expense of even less practical inferential machinery . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-79' AZ='OWN'> In applying the grammar in generation we are faced with the problem of balancing over and under-generation by tweaking grammatical constraints , there being no way to prefer fully grammatical target sentences over more marginal ones . </S>
<S ID='S-80' AZ='OWN'> Qualitative approaches to grammar tend to emphasize the ability to capture generalizations as the main measure of success in linguistic modeling . </S>
<S ID='S-81' AZ='OWN'> This might explain why producing appropriate lexical collocations is rarely addressed seriously in these models , even though lexical collocations are important for fluent generation . </S>
<S ID='S-82' AZ='OWN'> The study of collocations for generation fits in more naturally with statistical techniques , as illustrated by <REF TYPE='P'>Smadja and McKeown 1990</REF> . </S>
</P>

<DIV DEPTH='2'>
<HEADER ID='H-6'> Interpretation </HEADER>
<P>
<S ID='S-83' AZ='OWN'> In the logic-based model , interpretation is the process of identifying from the possible interpretations <EQN/> of s for which <EQN/> hold , ones that are consistent with the context of interpretation . </S>
<S ID='S-84' AZ='OWN'> We can state this as follows : </S>
</P>
<IMAGE ID='I-5'/>
<P>
<S ID='S-85' AZ='OWN'> Here , we have separated the context into a contingent set of contextual propositions S and a set R of ( monolingual ) ` meaning postulates ' , or selectional restrictions , that constrain the word sense predicates in all contexts . </S>
<S ID='S-86' AZ='OWN'> A is a set of assumptions sufficient to support the interpretation <EQN/> given S and R . </S>
<S ID='S-87' AZ='OWN'> In other words , this is ` interpretation as abduction ' <REF TYPE='P'>Hobbs et al. 1988</REF> , since abduction , not deduction , is needed to arrive at the assumptions A . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-88' AZ='OWN'> The most common types of meaning postulates in R are those for restriction , hyponymy , and disjointness , expressed as follows : </S>
<S ID='S-89' AZ='OWN'> <EQN/> restriction ; </S>
<S ID='S-90' AZ='OWN'> <EQN/> hyponymy ; </S>
<S ID='S-91' AZ='OWN'> <EQN/> disjointness . </S>
<S ID='S-92' AZ='CTR'> Although there are compilation techniques <REF TYPE='P'>Mellish 1988</REF> which allow selectional constraints stated in this fashion to be implemented efficiently , the scheme is problematic in other respects . </S>
<S ID='S-93' AZ='CTR'> To start with , the assumption of a small set of senses for a word is at best awkward because it is difficult to arrive at an optimal granularity for sense distinctions . </S>
<S ID='S-94' AZ='CTR'> Disambiguation with selectional restrictions expressed as meaning postulates is also problematic because it is virtually impossible to devise a set of postulates that will always filter all but one alternative . </S>
<S ID='S-95' AZ='OWN'> We are thus forced to under-filter and make an arbitrary choice between remaining alternatives . </S>
</P>

<DIV DEPTH='2'>
<HEADER ID='H-7'> Logic based translation </HEADER>
<P>
<S ID='S-96' AZ='OWN'> In both the quantitative and qualitative models we take a transfer approach to translation . </S>
<S ID='S-97' AZ='OWN'> We do not depend on interlingual symbols , but instead map a representation with constants associated with the source language into a corresponding expression with constants from the target language . </S>
<S ID='S-98' AZ='OWN'> For the qualitative model , the operable notion of correspondence is based on logical equivalence and the constants are source word sense predicates <EQN/> and target sense predicates <EQN/> . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-99' AZ='OWN'> More specifically , we will say the translation relation between a source logical form <EQN/> and a target logical form <EQN/> holds if we have </S>
</P>
<IMAGE ID='I-6'/>
<P>
<S ID='S-100' AZ='OWN'> where B is a set of monolingual and bilingual meaning postulates , and S is a set of formulas characterizing the current context . </S>
<S ID='S-101' AZ='OWN'> A' is a set of assumptions that includes the assumptions A which supported <EQN/> . </S>
<S ID='S-102' AZ='OWN'> Here bilingual meaning postulates are first order axioms relating source and target sense predicates . </S>
<S ID='S-103' AZ='OWN'> A typical bilingual postulate for translating between <EQN/> and <EQN/> might be of the form :</S>
</P>
<IMAGE ID='I-7'/>
<P>
<S ID='S-104' AZ='OWN'> The need for the assumptions A' arises when a source language word is vaguer that its possible translations in the target language , so different choices of target words will correspond to translations under different assumptions . </S>
<S ID='S-105' AZ='OWN'> For example , the condition <EQN/> above might be proved from the input logical form , or it might need to be assumed . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-106' AZ='OWN'> In the general case , finding solutions ( i.e. <EQN/> pairs ) for the abductive schema is an undecidable theorem proving problem . </S>
<S ID='S-107' AZ='OWN'> This can be alleviated by placing restrictions on the form of meaning postulates and input formulas and using heuristic search methods . </S>
<S ID='S-108' AZ='CTR'> Although such an approach was applied with some success in a limited-domain system translating logical forms into database queries <REF TYPE='P' SELF="YES">Rayner and Alshawi 1992</REF> , it is likely to be impractical for language translation with tens of thousands of sense predicates and related axioms . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-109' AZ='OWN'> Setting aside the intractability issue , this approach does not offer a principled way of choosing between alternative solutions proposed by the prover . </S>
<S ID='S-110' AZ='OWN'> One would like to prefer solutions with ` minimal ' sets of assumptions , but it is difficult to find motivated definitions for this minimization in a purely qualitative framework . </S>

<HEADER ID='H-19'> Conclusions </HEADER>
<P>
<S ID='S-276' AZ='OWN'> Our qualitative and quantitative models have a similar overall structure and there are clear parallels between the factoring of logical constraints and statistical parameters , for example monolingual postulates and dependency parameters , bilingual postulates and translation parameters . </S>
<S ID='S-277' AZ='OWN'> The parallelism would have been closer if we had adopted ID / LP style rules <REF TYPE='P'>Gazdar et al. 1985</REF> in the qualitative model . </S>
<S ID='S-278' AZ='OWN'> However , we argued in section <CREF/> that our qualitative model suffered from lack of robustness , from having only the crudest means for choosing between competing hypotheses , and from being computationally intractable for large vocabularies . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-279' AZ='OWN'> The quantitative model is in a much better position to cope with these problems . </S>
<S ID='S-280' AZ='OWN'> It is less brittle because statistical associations have replaced constraints ( featural , selectional , etc. ) that must be satisfied exactly . </S>
<S ID='S-281' AZ='OWN'> The probabilistic models give us a systematic and well motivated way of ranking alternative hypotheses . </S>
<S ID='S-282' AZ='OWN'> Computationally , the quantitative model lets us escape from the undecidability of logic-based reasoning . </S>
<S ID='S-283' AZ='OWN'> Because this model is highly lexical , we can hope that the input words will allow effective pruning by limiting the number of search paths having significantly high probabilities . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-284' AZ='OWN'> We retained some of the basic assumptions about the structure of language when moving to the quantitative model . </S>
<S ID='S-285' AZ='OWN'> In particular , we preserved the notion of hierarchical phrase structure . </S>
<S ID='S-286' AZ='OWN'> Relations motivated by dependency grammar made it possible to do this without giving up sensitivity to lexical collocations which underpin simple statistical models like N-grams . </S>
<S ID='S-287' AZ='OWN'> The quantitative model also reduced overall complexity in terms of the sets of symbols used . </S>
<S ID='S-288' AZ='OWN'> In addition to words , it only required symbols for dependency relations , whereas the qualitative model required symbol sets for linguistic categories and features , and a set of word sense symbols . </S>
<S ID='S-289' AZ='OWN'> Despite their apparent importance to translation , the quantitative system can avoid the use of word sense symbols ( and the problems of granularity they give rise to ) by exploiting statistical associations between words in the target language to filter implicit sense choices . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-290' AZ='OWN' TYPE='ITEM'> Finally , here is a summary of our reasons for combining statistical methods with dependency representations in our language and translation models : </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-291' TYPE='ITEM' AZ='OWN' > inherent lexical sensitivity of dependency representations , facilitating parameter estimation ; </S>
<S ID='S-292' TYPE='ITEM' AZ='OWN' > quantitative preference based on probabilistic derivation and translation ; </S>
<S ID='S-293' TYPE='ITEM' AZ='OWN' > incremental and / or partial specification of the content of utterances , particularly useful in translation ; </S>
<S ID='S-294' TYPE='ITEM' AZ='OWN' > decomposition of complex utterances through recursive linguistic structure . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-295' AZ='OWN'> These factors suggest that dependency grammar will play an increasingly important role as language processing systems seek to combine both structural and collocational information . </S>
