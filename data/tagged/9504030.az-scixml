<ABSTRACT>
<A-S ID='A-0' AZ='CTR'> Syntactic natural language parsers have shown themselves to be inadequate for processing highly-ambiguous large-vocabulary text , as is evidenced by their poor performance on domains like the Wall Street Journal , and by the movement away from parsing-based approaches to text-processing in general . </A-S>
<A-S ID='A-1' AZ='AIM'> In this paper , I describe SPATTER , a statistical parser based on decision-tree learning techniques which constructs a complete parse for every sentence and achieves accuracy rates far better than any published result . </A-S>
<A-S ID='A-2' AZ='OWN'> This work is based on the following premises : </A-S>
<A-S ID='A-3' TYPE='ITEM' AZ='OWN'> grammars are too complex and detailed to develop manually for most interesting domains ; </A-S>
<A-S ID='A-4' TYPE='ITEM' AZ='OWN'> parsing models must rely heavily on lexical and contextual information to analyze sentences accurately ; and </A-S>
<A-S ID='A-5' TYPE='ITEM' AZ='OWN'> existing n-gram modeling techniques are inadequate for parsing models . </A-S>
<A-S ID='A-6' DOCUMENTC='S-20' AZ='CTR'> In experiments comparing SPATTER with IBM 's computer manuals parser , SPATTER significantly outperforms the grammar-based parser . </A-S>

<HEADER ID='H-0'> Introduction </HEADER>
<P>
<S ID='S-0' AZ='BKG'> Parsing a natural language sentence can be viewed as making a sequence of disambiguation decisions : determining the part-of-speech of the words , choosing between possible constituent structures , and selecting labels for the constituents . </S>
<S ID='S-1' AZ='OTH'> Traditionally , disambiguation problems in parsing have been addressed by enumerating possibilities and explicitly declaring knowledge which might aid the disambiguation process . </S>
<S ID='S-2' AZ='CTR'> However , these approaches have proved too brittle for most interesting natural language problems . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-3' AZ='AIM'> This work addresses the problem of automatically discovering the disambiguation criteria for all of the decisions made during the parsing process , given the set of possible features which can act as disambiguators . </S>
<S ID='S-4' AZ='OWN'> The candidate disambiguators are the words in the sentence , relationships among the words , and relationships among constituents already constructed in the parsing process . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-5' AZ='OWN'> Since most natural language rules are not absolute , the disambiguation criteria discovered in this work are never applied deterministically . </S>
<S ID='S-6' AZ='OWN'> Instead , all decisions are pursued non-deterministically according to the probability of each choice . </S>
<S ID='S-7' AZ='OWN'> These probabilities are estimated using statistical decision tree models . </S>
<S ID='S-8' AZ='OWN'> The probability of a complete parse tree ( T ) of a sentence ( S ) is the product of each decision ( <EQN/> ) conditioned on all previous decisions : </S>
</P>
<IMAGE ID='I-0'/>
<P>
<S ID='S-9' AZ='OWN'> Each decision sequence constructs a unique parse , and the parser selects the parse whose decision sequence yields the highest cumulative probability . </S>
<S ID='S-10' AZ='OWN'> By combining a stack decoder search with a breadth-first algorithm with probabilistic pruning , it is possible to identify the highest-probability parse for any sentence using a reasonable amount of memory and time . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-11' AZ='AIM'> The claim of this work is that statistics from a large corpus of parsed sentences combined with information-theoretic classification and training algorithms can produce an accurate natural language parser without the aid of a complicated knowledge base or grammar . </S>
<S ID='S-12' AZ='AIM'> This claim is justified by constructing a parser , called SPATTER ( Statistical PATTErn Recognizer ) , based on very limited linguistic information , and comparing its performance to a state-of-the-art grammar-based parser on a common task . </S>
<S ID='S-13' AZ='OWN'> It remains to be shown that an accurate broad-coverage parser can improve the performance of a text processing application . </S>
<S ID='S-14' AZ='OWN'> This will be the subject of future experiments . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-15' AZ='CTR'> One of the important points of this work is that statistical models of natural language should not be restricted to simple , context-insensitive models . </S>
<S ID='S-16' AZ='CTR'> In a problem like parsing , where long-distance lexical information is crucial to disambiguate interpretations accurately , local models like probabilistic context-free grammars are inadequate . </S>
<S ID='S-17' AZ='BAS'> This work illustrates that existing decision-tree technology can be used to construct and estimate models which selectively choose elements of the context which contribute to disambiguation decisions , and which have few enough parameters to be trained using existing resources . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-18' AZ='TXT'> I begin by describing decision-tree modeling , showing that decision-tree models are equivalent to interpolated n-gram models . </S>
<S ID='S-19' AZ='TXT'> Then I briefly describe the training and parsing procedures used in SPATTER . </S>
<S ID='S-20' ABSTRACTC='A-6' AZ='TXT'> Finally , I present some results of experiments comparing SPATTER with a grammarian 's rule-based statistical parser , along with more recent results showing SPATTER applied to the Wall Street Journal domain . </S>

<HEADER ID='H-1'> Decision-Tree Modeling </HEADER>
<P>
<S ID='S-21' AZ='OWN'> Much of the work in this paper depends on replacing human decision-making skills with automatic decision-making algorithms . </S>
<S ID='S-22' AZ='OWN'> The decisions under consideration involve identifying constituents and constituent labels in natural language sentences . </S>
<S ID='S-23' AZ='BKG'> Grammarians , the human decision-makers in parsing , solve this problem by enumerating the features of a sentence which affect the disambiguation decisions and indicating which parse to select based on the feature values . </S>
<S ID='S-24' AZ='BKG'> The grammarian is accomplishing two critical tasks : identifying the features which are relevant to each decision , and deciding which choice to select based on the values of the relevant features . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-25' AZ='OTH'> Decision-tree classification algorithms account for both of these tasks , and they also accomplish a third task which grammarians classically find difficult . </S>
<S ID='S-26' AZ='OTH'> By assigning a probability distribution to the possible choices , decision trees provide a ranking system which not only specifies the order of preference for the possible choices , but also gives a measure of the relative likelihood that each choice is the one which should be selected . </S>
</P>

<HEADER ID='H-2'> What is a Decision Tree ?</HEADER>
<P>
<S ID='S-27' AZ='OTH'> A decision tree is a decision-making device which assigns a probability to each of the possible choices based on the context of the decision : <EQN/> , where f is an element of the future vocabulary ( the set of choices ) and h is a history ( the context of the decision ) . </S>
<S ID='S-28' AZ='OTH'> This probability  <EQN/> is determined by asking a sequence of questions <EQN/> about the context , where the ith question asked is uniquely determined by the answers to the i - 1 previous questions . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-29' AZ='OTH'> For instance , consider the part-of-speech tagging problem . </S>
<S ID='S-30' AZ='OTH'> The first question a decision tree might ask is : </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-31' AZ='OTH'> What is the word being tagged ? </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-32' AZ='OTH'> If the answer is the , then the decision tree needs to ask no more questions ; it is clear that the decision tree should assign the tag <EQN/> with probability 1 . </S>
<S ID='S-33' AZ='OTH'> If , instead , the answer to question 1 is bear , the decision tree might next ask the question : 2 . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-34' AZ='OTH'> What is the tag of the previous word ? </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-35' AZ='OTH'> If the answer to question 2 is determiner , the decision tree might stop asking questions and assign the tag <EQN/> with very high probability , and the tag <EQN/> with much lower probability . </S>
<S ID='S-36' AZ='OTH'> However , if the answer to question 2 is noun , the decision tree would need to ask still more questions to get a good estimate of the probability of the tagging decision . </S>
<S ID='S-37' AZ='OTH'> The decision tree described in this paragraph is shown in Figure <CREF/> . </S>
<IMAGE ID='I-1'/>
<S ID='S-38' AZ='OTH'> Each question asked by the decision tree is represented by a tree node ( an oval in the figure ) and the possible answers to this question are associated with branches emanating from the node . </S>
<S ID='S-39' AZ='OTH'> Each node defines a probability distribution on the space of possible decisions . </S>
<S ID='S-40' AZ='OTH'> A node at which the decision tree stops asking questions is a leaf node . </S>
<S ID='S-41' AZ='OTH'> The leaf nodes represent the unique states in the decision-making problem , i.e. all contexts which lead to the same leaf node have the same probability distribution for the decision . </S>
</P>

<HEADER ID='H-3'> Decision Trees vs. n-grams </HEADER>
<P>
<S ID='S-42' AZ='OTH'> A decision-tree model is not really very different from an interpolated n-gram model . </S>
<S ID='S-43' AZ='OTH'> In fact , they are equivalent in representational power . </S>
<S ID='S-44' AZ='OTH'> The main differences between the two modeling techniques are how the models are parameterized and how the parameters are estimated . </S>
</P>
<DIV DEPTH='3'>
<HEADER ID='H-4'> Model Parameterization </HEADER>
<P>
<S ID='S-45' AZ='OTH'> First , let 's be very clear on what we mean by an n-gram model . </S>
<S ID='S-46' AZ='OTH'> Usually , an n-gram model refers to a Markov process where the probability of a particular token being generating is dependent on the values of the previous n - 1 tokens generated by the same process . </S>
<S ID='S-47' AZ='OTH'> By this definition , an n-gram model has <EQN/> parameters , where | W | is the number of unique tokens generated by the process . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-48' AZ='OTH'> However , here let 's define an n-gram model more loosely as a model which defines a probability distribution on a random variable given the values of n - 1 random variables , <EQN/> There is no assumption in the definition that any of the random variables F or <EQN/> range over the same vocabulary . </S>
<S ID='S-49' AZ='OTH'> The number of parameters in this n-gram model is <EQN/> . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-50' AZ='OTH'> Using this definition , an n-gram model can be represented by a decision-tree model with n - 1 questions . </S>
<S ID='S-51' AZ='OTH'> For instance , the part-of-speech tagging model <EQN/> can be interpreted as a 4-gram model , where <EQN/> is the variable denoting the word being tagged , <EQN/> is the variable denoting the tag of the previous word , and <EQN/> is the variable denoting the tag of the word two words back . </S>
<S ID='S-52' AZ='OTH'> Hence , this 4-gram tagging model is the same as a decision-tree model which always asks the sequence of 3 questions : </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-53' TYPE='ITEM' AZ='OTH' > What is the word being tagged ? </S>
<S ID='S-54' TYPE='ITEM' AZ='OTH' > What is the tag of the previous word ? </S>
<S ID='S-55' TYPE='ITEM' AZ='OTH' > What is the tag of the word two words back ? </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-56' AZ='OTH'> But can a decision-tree model be represented by an n-gram model ? </S>
<S ID='S-57' AZ='OTH'> No , but it can be represented by an interpolated n-gram model . </S>
<S ID='S-58' AZ='TXT'> The proof of this assertion is given in the next section . </S>
</P>
</DIV>
<DIV DEPTH='3'>
<HEADER ID='H-5'> Model Estimation </HEADER>
<P>
<S ID='S-59' AZ='OTH'> The standard approach to estimating an n-gram model is a two step process . </S>
<S ID='S-60' AZ='OTH'> The first step is to count the number of occurrences of each n-gram from a training corpus . </S>
<S ID='S-61' AZ='OTH'> This process determines the empirical distribution , </S>
<IMAGE ID='I-2'/>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-62' AZ='OTH'> The second step is smoothing the empirical distribution using a separate , held-out corpus . </S>
<S ID='S-63' AZ='OTH'> This step improves the empirical distribution by finding statistically unreliable parameter estimates and adjusting them based on more reliable information . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-64' AZ='OTH'> A commonly-used technique for smoothing is deleted interpolation . </S>
<S ID='S-65' AZ='OTH'> Deleted interpolation estimates a model <EQN/> by using a linear combination of empirical models <EQN/> where <EQN/> and <EQN/> for all <EQN/> </S>
<S ID='S-66' AZ='OTH'> For example , a model <EQN/> might be interpolated as follows : </S>
<IMAGE ID='I-3'/>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-67' AZ='OTH'> where <EQN/> for all histories <EQN/> .</S>
<S ID='S-68' AZ='OTH'> The optimal values for the <EQN/> functions can be estimated using the forward-backward algorithm <REF TYPE='P'>Baum 1972</REF> . </S>
<S ID='S-69' AZ='OWN'> A decision-tree model can be represented by an interpolated n-gram model as follows . </S>
<S ID='S-70' AZ='OWN'> A leaf node in a decision tree can be represented by the sequence of question answers , or history values , which leads the decision tree to that leaf . </S>
<S ID='S-71' AZ='OWN'> Thus , a leaf node defines a probability distribution based on values of those questions : <EQN/> where <EQN/> and <EQN/> and where <EQN/> is the answer to one of the questions asked on the path from the root to the leaf . </S>
<S ID='S-72' AZ='OWN'> But this is the same as one of the terms in the interpolated n-gram model . </S>
<S ID='S-73' AZ='OWN'> So , a decision tree can be defined as an interpolated n-gram model where the <EQN/> function is defined as : </S>

<HEADER ID='H-6'> Decision-Tree Algorithms </HEADER>
<P>
<S ID='S-74' AZ='OWN'> The point of showing the equivalence between n-gram models and decision-tree models is to make clear that the power of decision-tree models is not in their expressiveness , but instead in how they can be automatically acquired for very large modeling problems . </S>
<S ID='S-75' AZ='OTH'> As n grows , the parameter space for an n-gram model grows exponentially , and it quickly becomes computationally infeasible to estimate the smoothed model using deleted interpolation . </S>
<S ID='S-76' AZ='OTH'> Also , as n grows large , the likelihood that the deleted interpolation process will converge to an optimal or even near-optimal parameter setting becomes vanishingly small . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-77' AZ='OTH'> On the other hand , the decision-tree learning algorithm increases the size of a model only as the training data allows . </S>
<S ID='S-78' AZ='OTH'> Thus , it can consider very large history spaces , i.e. n-gram models with very large n. Regardless of the value of n , the number of parameters in the resulting model will remain relatively constant , depending mostly on the number of training examples . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-79' AZ='OTH'> The leaf distributions in decision trees are empirical estimates , i.e. relative-frequency counts from the training data . </S>
<S ID='S-80' AZ='CTR'> Unfortunately , they assign probability zero to events which can possibly occur . </S>
<S ID='S-81' AZ='OWN'> Therefore , just as it is necessary to smooth empirical n-gram models , it is also necessary to smooth empirical decision-tree models . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-82' AZ='BAS'> The decision-tree learning algorithms used in this work were developed over the past 15 years by the IBM Speech Recognition group <REF TYPE='P'>Bahl et al. 1989</REF> . </S>

</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-85' AZ='OWN'> An important point which has been omitted from this discussion of decision trees is the fact that only binary questions are used in these decision trees . </S>
<S ID='S-86' AZ='OWN'> A question which has k values is decomposed into a sequence of binary questions using a classification tree on those k values . </S>
<S ID='S-87' AZ='OWN'> For example , a question about a word is represented as 30 binary questions . </S>
<S ID='S-88' AZ='BAS'> These 30 questions are determined by growing a classification tree on the word vocabulary as described in <REF TYPE='A'>Brown et al. 1992</REF> . </S>
<S ID='S-89' AZ='OTH'> The 30 questions represent 30 different binary partitions of the word vocabulary , and these questions are defined such that it is possible to identify each word by asking all 30 questions . </S>

<S ID='S-151' AZ='OWN'> The parser was trained on the first 30,800 sentences from the Lancaster treebank . </S>

<S ID='S-154' AZ='OWN'> In <REF TYPE='A'>Black et al. 1993</REF> , IBM 's parser was evaluated using the 0-crossing - brackets measure , which represents the percentage of sentences for which none of the constituents in the parser 's parse violates the constituent boundaries of any constituent in the correct parse . </S>
<S ID='S-155' AZ='CTR'> After over ten years of grammar development , the IBM parser achieved a 0-crossing - brackets score of 69 % . </S>

<P>
<S ID='S-184' AZ='OWN'> Regardless of what techniques are used for parsing disambiguation , one thing is clear : if a particular piece of information is necessary for solving a disambiguation problem , it must be made available to the disambiguation mechanism . </S>
<S ID='S-185' AZ='OWN'> The words in the sentence are clearly necessary to make parsing decisions , and in some cases long-distance structural information is also needed . </S>
<S ID='S-186' AZ='CTR'> Statistical models for parsing need to consider many more features of a sentence than can be managed by n-gram modeling techniques and many more examples than a human can keep track of . </S>
<S ID='S-187' AZ='AIM'> The SPATTER parser illustrates how large amounts of contextual information can be incorporated into a statistical model for parsing by applying decision-tree learning algorithms to a large annotated corpus . </S>
