<ABSTRACT>
<A-S ID='A-0' DOCUMENTC='S-27' AZ='BKG'> Drawing appropriate defeasible inferences has been proven to be one of the most pervasive puzzles of natural language processing and a recurrent problem in pragmatics . </A-S>
<A-S ID='A-1' AZ='AIM'> This paper provides a theoretical framework , called stratified logic , that can accommodate defeasible pragmatic inferences . </A-S>
<A-S ID='A-2' AZ='OWN'> The framework yields an algorithm that computes the conversational , conventional , scalar , clausal , and normal state implicatures ; and the presuppositions that are associated with utterances . </A-S>
<A-S ID='A-3' DOCUMENTC='S-130' AZ='OWN'> The algorithm applies equally to simple and complex utterances and sequences of utterances . </A-S>

<HEADER ID='H-0'> Pragmatics and Defeasibility </HEADER>
<P>
<S ID='S-0' AZ='BKG'> It is widely acknowledged that a full account of natural language utterances cannot be given in terms of only syntactic or semantic phenomena . </S>
<S ID='S-1' AZ='BKG'> For example , <REF TYPE='A'>Hirschberg 1985</REF> has shown that in order to understand a scalar implicature , one must analyze the conversants ' beliefs and intentions . </S>
<S ID='S-2' AZ='BKG'> To recognize normal state implicatures one must consider mutual beliefs and plans <REF TYPE='P'>Green 1990</REF> . </S>
<S ID='S-3' AZ='BKG'> To understand conversational implicatures associated with indirect replies one must consider discourse expectations , discourse plans , and discourse relations <REF  TYPE='P'>Green 1992</REF>, <REF  TYPE='P'>Green and Carberry 1994</REF> . </S>
<S ID='S-4' AZ='BKG'> Some presuppositions are inferrable when certain lexical constructs ( factives , aspectuals , etc ) or syntactic constructs ( cleft and pseudo-cleft sentences ) are used . </S>
<S ID='S-5' AZ='BKG'> Despite all the complexities that individualize the recognition stage for each of these inferences , all of them can be defeated by context , by knowledge , beliefs , or plans of the agents that constitute part of the context , or by other pragmatic rules . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-6' AZ='BKG'> Defeasibility is a notion that is tricky to deal with , and scholars in logics and pragmatics have learned to circumvent it or live with it . </S>
<S ID='S-7' AZ='OTH'> The first observers of the phenomenon preferred to keep defeasibility outside the mathematical world . </S>
<S ID='S-8' AZ='OTH'> For <REF TYPE='A'>Frege 1892</REF> , <REF TYPE='A'>Russell 1905</REF> , and <REF TYPE='A'>Quine 1949</REF> `` everything exists '' ; therefore , in their logical systems , it is impossible to formalize the cancellation of the presupposition that definite referents exist <REF  SELF="YES" TYPE='P'>Hirst 1991</REF>, <REF  SELF="YES" TYPE='P'>Marcu and Hirst 1994</REF> . </S>
<S ID='S-9' AZ='OWN'> We can taxonomize previous approaches to defeasible pragmatic inferences into three categories ( we omit here work on defeasibility related to linguistic phenomena such as discourse , anaphora , or speech acts ) . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-10' AZ='OTH'> Most linguistic approaches account for the defeasibility of pragmatic inferences by analyzing them in a context that consists of all or some of the previous utterances , including the current one . </S>
<S ID='S-11' AZ='OTH'> Context <REF TYPE='P'>Karttunen 1974</REF> , <REF TYPE='P'>Kay 1992</REF> , procedural rules <REF TYPE='P'>Gazdar 1979</REF> , <REF TYPE='P'>Karttunen and Peters 1979</REF> , lexical and syntactic structure <REF TYPE='P'>Weischedel 1979</REF> , intentions <REF TYPE='P'>Hirschberg 1985</REF> , or anaphoric constraints <REF TYPE='P'>Sandt 1992</REF> , <REF TYPE='P'>Zeevat 1992</REF> decide what presuppositions or implicatures are projected as pragmatic inferences for the utterance that is analyzed . </S>
<S ID='S-12' AZ='CTR'> The problem with these approaches is that they assign a dual life to pragmatic inferences : in the initial stage , as members of a simple or complex utterance , they are defeasible . </S>
<S ID='S-13' AZ='CTR'> However , after that utterance is analyzed , there is no possibility left of cancelling that inference . </S>
<S ID='S-14' AZ='CTR'> But it is natural to have implicatures and presuppositions that are inferred and cancelled as a sequence of utterances proceeds : research in conversation repairs <REF TYPE='P' SELF="YES">Hirst et al. 1994</REF> abounds in such examples . </S>
<S ID='S-15' AZ='TXT'> We address this issue in more detail in section <CREF/> . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-16' AZ='OTH'> One way of accounting for cancellations that occur later in the analyzed text is simply to extend the boundaries within which pragmatic inferences are evaluated , i.e. , to look ahead a few utterances . </S>
<S ID='S-17' AZ='CTR'> <REF TYPE='A'>Green 1992</REF> assumes that implicatures are connected to discourse entities and not to utterances , but her approach still does not allow cancellations across discourse units . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-18' AZ='OTH'> Another way of allowing pragmatic inferences to be cancelled is to assign them the status of defeasible information . </S>
<S ID='S-19' AZ='CTR'> <REF TYPE='A'>Mercer 1987</REF> formalizes presuppositions in a logical framework that handles defaults <REF TYPE='P'>Reiter 1980</REF> , but this approach is not tractable and it treats natural disjunction as an exclusive-or and implication as logical equivalence . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-20' AZ='CTR'> Computational approaches fail to account for the cancellation of pragmatic inferences : once presuppositions <REF TYPE='P'>Weischedel 1979</REF> or implicatures <REF TYPE='P'>Hirschberg 1985</REF> , <REF TYPE='P'>Green 1992</REF> are generated , they can never be cancelled . </S>
<S ID='S-21' AZ='CTR'> We are not aware of any formalism or computational approach that offers a unified explanation for the cancellability of pragmatic inferences in general , and of no approach that handles cancellations that occur in sequences of utterances . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-22' AZ='AIM'> It is our aim to provide such an approach here . </S>
<S ID='S-23' AZ='OWN'> In doing this , we assume the existence , for each type of pragmatic inference , of a set of necessary conditions that must be true in order for that inference to be triggered . </S>
<S ID='S-24' AZ='OWN'> Once such a set of conditions is met , the corresponding inference is drawn , but it is assigned a defeasible status . </S>
<S ID='S-25' AZ='OWN'> It is the role of context and knowledge of the conversants to `` decide '' whether that inference will survive or not as a pragmatic inference of the structure . </S>
<S ID='S-26' AZ='OWN'> We put no boundaries upon the time when such a cancellation can occur , and we offer a unified explanation for pragmatic inferences that are inferable when simple utterances , complex utterances , or sequences of utterances are considered . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-27' ABSTRACTC='A-0' AZ='AIM'> We propose a new formalism , called `` stratified logic '' , that correctly handles the pragmatic inferences , and we start by giving a very brief introduction to the main ideas that underlie it . </S>
<S ID='S-28' AZ='TXT'> We give the main steps of the algorithm that is defined on the backbone of stratified logic . </S>
<S ID='S-29' AZ='TXT'> We then show how different classes of pragmatic inferences can be captured using this formalism , and how our algorithm computes the expected results for a representative class of pragmatic inferences . </S>
<S ID='S-30' AZ='BAS'> The results we report here are obtained using an implementation written in Common Lisp that uses Screamer <REF TYPE='P'>Siskind and McAllester 1993</REF> , a macro package that provides nondeterministic constructs . </S>

<S ID='S-31' AZ='OWN'> We can offer here only a brief overview of stratified logic . </S>
<S ID='S-32' AZ='BAS'> The reader is referred to <REF TYPE='A' SELF="YES">Marcu 1994</REF> for a comprehensive study . </S>
<S ID='S-33' AZ='OWN'> Stratified logic supports one type of indefeasible information and two types of defeasible information , namely , infelicitously defeasible and felicitously defeasible . </S>
<S ID='S-34' AZ='BKG'> The notion of infelicitously defeasible information is meant to capture inferences that are anomalous to cancel , as in : </S>
<EXAMPLE ID='E-0'>
<EX-S> * John regrets that Mary came to the party but she did not come . </EX-S>

<EX-S> John does not regret that Mary came to the party because she did not come . </EX-S>
</EXAMPLE>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-36' AZ='OWN'> The lattice in figure <CREF/> underlies the semantics of stratified logic . </S>
<S ID='S-37' AZ='OWN'> The lattice depicts the three levels of strength that seem to account for the inferences that pertain to natural language semantics and pragmatics : indefeasible information belongs to the u layer , infelicitously defeasible information belongs to the i layer , and felicitously defeasible information belongs to the d layer . </S>
<S ID='S-38' AZ='OWN'> Each layer is partitioned according to its polarity in truth , <EQN/> , and falsity , <EQN/> . </S>
<S ID='S-39' AZ='OWN'> The lattice shows a partial order that is defined over the different levels of truth . </S>
<S ID='S-40' AZ='OWN'> For example , something that is indefeasibly false , <EQN/> , is stronger ( in a sense to be defined below ) than something that is infelicitously defeasibly true , <EQN/> , or felicitously defeasibly false , <EQN/> . </S>
<S ID='S-41' AZ='OWN'> Formally , we say that the u level is stronger than the i level , which is stronger than the d level : <EQN/> . </S>
<IMAGE ID='I-0'/>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-42' AZ='OWN'> At the syntactic level , we allow atomic formulas to be labelled according to the same underlying lattice . </S>
<S ID='S-43' AZ='OWN'> Compound formulas are obtained in the usual way . </S>
<S ID='S-44' AZ='OWN'> This will give us formulas such as <EQN/> , or <EQN/> . </S>
<S ID='S-45' AZ='OWN'> The satisfaction relation is split according to the three levels of truth into u-satisfaction , i-satisfaction , and d-satisfaction : </S>

<P>
<S ID='S-46' AZ='OWN'> Definition <CREF/> extends in a natural way to negated and compound formulas . </S>
<S ID='S-47' AZ='OWN'> Having a satisfaction definition associated with each level of strength provides a high degree of flexibility . </S>
<S ID='S-48' AZ='OWN'> The same theory can be interpreted from a perspective that allows more freedom ( u-satisfaction ) , or from a perspective that is tighter and that signals when some defeasible information has been cancelled ( i - and d-satisfaction ) . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-49' AZ='OWN'> Possible interpretations of a given set of utterances with respect to a knowledge base are computed using an extension of the semantic tableau method . </S>
<S ID='S-50' AZ='BAS'> This extension has been proved to be both sound and complete <REF SELF="YES" TYPE='P'>Marcu 1994</REF> . </S>
<S ID='S-51' AZ='OWN'> A partial ordering , <EQN/> , determines the set of optimistic interpretations for a theory . </S>
<S ID='S-52' AZ='OWN'> An interpretation <EQN/> is preferred to , or is more optimistic than , an interpretation <EQN/> ( <EQN/> ) if it contains more information and that information can be more easily updated in the future . </S>
<S ID='S-53' AZ='OWN'> That means that if an interpretation <EQN/> makes an utterance true by assigning to a relation R a defeasible status , while another interpretation <EQN/> makes the same utterance true by assigning the same relation R a stronger status , <EQN/> will be the preferred or optimistic one , because it is as informative as <EQN/> and it allows more options in the future ( R can be defeated ) . </S>

<P>
<S ID='S-54' AZ='OWN'> Pragmatic inferences are triggered by utterances . </S>
<S ID='S-55' AZ='OWN'> To differentiate between them and semantic inferences , we introduce a new quantifier , <EQN/> , whose semantics is defined such that a pragmatic inference of the form <EQN/> is instantiated only for those objects <EQN/> from the universe of discourse that pertain to an utterance having the form <EQN/> . </S>
<S ID='S-56' AZ='OWN'> Hence , only if the antecedent of a pragmatic rule has been uttered can that rule be applied . </S>

<S ID='S-59' AZ='BAS'> Our algorithm , described in detail by <REF TYPE='A' SELF="YES">Marcu 1994</REF> , takes as input a set of first-order stratified formulas <EQN/> that represents an adequate knowledge base that expresses semantic knowledge and the necessary conditions for triggering pragmatic inferences , and the translation of an utterance or set of utterances uttered ( u ) . </S>
<S ID='S-60' AZ='OWN'> The algorithm builds the set of all possible interpretations for a given utterance , using a generalization of the semantic tableau technique . </S>
<S ID='S-61' AZ='OWN'> The model-ordering relation filters the optimistic interpretations . </S>

<S ID='S-127' AZ='OWN'> An extended definition of satisfaction and a notion of `` optimism '' with respect to different interpretations yield the preferred interpretations for an utterance or sequences of utterances . </S>
<S ID='S-128' AZ='OWN'> These interpretations contain the pragmatic inferences that have not been cancelled by context or conversant 's knowledge , plans , or intentions . </S>
