Eczema Is Associated with Childhood Speech Disorder: A Retrospective Analysis from the National Survey of Children's Health and the National Health Interview Survey.

Abstract

To determine if eczema is associated with an increased risk of a speech disorder.

We analyzed data on 354 416 children and adolescents from 19 US population-based cohorts: the 2003–2004 and 2007–2008 National Survey of Children’s Health and 1997–2013 National Health Interview Survey, each prospective, questionnaire-based cohorts.

In multivariate survey logistic regression models adjusting for sociodemographics and comorbid allergic disease, eczema was significantly associated with higher odds of speech disorder in 12 of 19 cohorts (P < .05). The pooled prevalence of speech disorder in children with eczema was 4.7% (95% CI 4.5%–5.0%) compared with 2.2% (95% CI 2.2%–2.3%) in children without eczema. In pooled multivariate analysis, eczema was associated with increased odds of speech disorder (aOR [95% CI] 1.81 [1.57–2.05], P < .001). In a single study assessing eczema severity, mild (1.36 [1.02–1.81], P = .03) and severe eczema (3.56 [1.70–7.48], P < .001) were associated with higher odds of speech disorder. History of eczema was associated with moderate (2.35 [1.34–4.10], P = .003) and severe (2.28 [1.11–4.72], P = .03) speech disorder. Finally, significant interactions were found, such that children with both eczema and attention deficit disorder with or without hyperactivity or sleep disturbance had vastly increased risk of speech disorders than either by itself.

Pediatric eczema may be associated with increased risk of speech disorder. Further, prospective studies are needed to characterize the exact nature of this association.

Methods

To determine if eczema is associated with an increased risk of a speech disorder.

We analyzed data on 354 416 children and adolescents from 19 US population-based cohorts: the 2003–2004 and 2007–2008 National Survey of Children’s Health and 1997–2013 National Health Interview Survey, each prospective, questionnaire-based cohorts.

Pediatric eczema may be associated with increased risk of speech disorder. Further, prospective studies are needed to characterize the exact nature of this association.

Eczema is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder with highest prevalence in childhood,1 which causes significant suffering because of itch, sleep disturbance,2 and decreased quality of life.3 Eczema is accompanied by profound systemic inflammation with activation of T-helper 2, 17, and 22 pathways.4–7 Systemic inflammation and/or the strong burden of atopic dermatitis may contribute toward a variety of health conditions. Indeed, we and other investigators have previously found childhood eczema to be associated with multiple comorbidities, including obesity,8–10 hypertension,10 low bone mineral density,11 increased risk of warts and extra-cutaneous infections,12 asthma,13 allergic rhinitis,13 attention deficit disorder (ADD)/attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),14,15 anxiety, depression, and conduct disorder.16,17

Many studies have reported on the negative neurocognitive outcomes of various chronic diseases of childhood, particularly language ability. For example, chronic otitis media,18,19 congenital heart disease,20 and chronic kidney disease21,22 have all have been associated with poor language and verbal performance in children. However, few studies have examined the neurocognitive ability of pediatric patients with eczema. Recently, we found that pediatric patients with eczema reported higher levels of contact with therapists, including speech therapists23 suggesting that eczema affects in some way the functional speech capability of children. Children with eczema have multiple risk factors for speech and language disorders, including sleep disturbance24,25 and ADHD.26 We hypothesized that eczema is independently associated with increased risk of speech problems in children, particularly in severe eczema, sleep disturbance, and comorbid ADHD. The present study analyzed 19 US population-based cohorts to determine whether there is an association between eczema and speech disorders.

Data were assessed from 19 different cohorts including the National Survey of Children’s Health (NSCH) 2003–2004 and 2007–2008 and the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) from the years 1997–2013. All surveys are collected by the National Center for Health Statistics, and the specific characteristics of each are reviewed (Table I; available at www.jpeds.com). In sampled households with multiple children, 1 child was randomly chosen to be the subject of the interview. Common to all samples is a multistage area probability sampling design that factors in age, sex, race, ethnicity, household size, and educational attainment of the most educated household member, using data from the US Census Bureau. Sample weights were created by the National Center for Health Statistics allowing for frequency and prevalence estimates that are representative of each state’s population of noninstitutionalized children. In this study, frequency and prevalence estimates presented in analyses of single samples reflect this complex weighting process. The similar sampling methodologies across the sample years allowed for weighted analysis of pooled results for NHIS (n = 17) and NSCH (n = 2), respectively. However, because of the differences in sampling methodology between NHIS and NSCH, sample weights for all 19 samples could not be combined in pooled analyses. Thus, in analyses of pooled weighted data of all 19 samples, meta-analysis of multivariate regression analysis effects were performed using a robust variance estimation method.27 This study was approved by the institutional review board at Northwestern University.

Survey characteristics
Associations with Eczema and Speech Disorder

Associations of both pediatric eczema and speech disorder were examined in children aged 3–17 years from NHIS 1997–2013 and NSCH 2003 and children aged 2–17 years from NSCH 2007 including sex, age, race, household income, highest level of household/parental education, birthplace in the US, and insurance coverage.

Associations between caregiver-reported history of eczema (19 samples) and eczema severity (1 sample) and speech disorder were examined both for each individual cohort and in pooled analyses. Interactions between eczema and several comorbidities including ADD/ADHD, sleep disturbance, fatigue, and depression were examined for their effect on speech disorders. Contrast statements were used to determine the differential effect of each on the risk of speech disorder.
Statistical Analyses

All data analyses and statistical processes were performed using the SURVEY procedures in SAS v 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina). Weighted population-based frequencies and prevalences were assessed for each study (PROC SURVEYFREQ). Multivariate survey logistic regression models were constructed for individual samples and pooled years of NSCH or NHIS accounting for the surveys’ complex weighting. The dependent variable in each model was the history of speech disorder in the past year. The independent variables were either 1-year history of eczema (ie, active eczema in the past year [yes/no] or eczema severity [no eczema/mild/moderate/severe]). Age (2–6/7–11/12–17 years), sex (male/female), race/ethnicity (non-His-panic Caucasian/non-Hispanic African American/Hispanic/multiracial or other), household income (0%–99%/100%–199%/200%–399%/400%+ federal poverty level), level of education of the highest member of the family/highest level of parental education (less than high school/high school or graduate equivalence degree/more than high school), insurance status (yes/no), birthplace (US/outside US), lifetime history of asthma (yes/no), and 1-year history of hay fever (yes/no) and digestive allergy (yes/no) were included as covariates. In addition, there was concern that diagnosis of comorbidity was related to overall increased healthcare utilization. Thus, a second multivariate model was created to examine the effect of eczema on speech disorder when controlling for number of outpatient visits per year. The aOR and 95% CI were determined. Two-way interactions between covariates were assessed and noted if significant (P < .01) and modified the effect size by ≥20%.

Our a priori hypothesis was that psychological and sleep dysfunction occurring in eczema is particularly associated with speech disorder. History of ADD/ADHD was assessed in all samples, whereas depression and number of nights of adequate sleep per week were assessed in NSCH 2007–2008. Fatigue and insomnia were assessed in NHIS 2007 and 2012, and daytime sleepiness was assessed in NHIS 2012 only. These variables and interaction terms with history of eczema were included in multivariate models. Estimates of effect size for significant interactions between the 2 variables were conducted for each level of the covariates using contrast statements. The various questions used in this study to assess eczema, speech disorder, depression, ADD/ADHD, and sleep disturbance are presented (Table II; available at www.jpeds.com).

Questions used in this study

Complete data analysis was performed in that subjects with missing data were excluded. The frequency of missing values from each study is presented (Table III; available at www.jpeds.com). Analysis of missing value patterns for speech disorder found that missing values were not more likely to occur in various age groups, racial and ethnic groups, family income levels, or education levels.

Data were analyzed on 354 416 US children and adolescents age 2–17 years, including those of all racial/ethnic groups, sex, levels of household income, and birthplaces. The pooled prevalence of eczema from all 19 samples was 10.1% (95% CI 10.0%–10.2%) (Table IV; available at www.jpeds.com). In pooled, bivariate logistic regression models, eczema was positively associated with female sex, and African American and multiracial race. In contrast, eczema was inversely associated with older age (7–11 years, 12–17 years), Hispanic ethnicity, less than high school level of household education, foreign birthplace, and lack of insurance coverage.

Pooled prevalence of eczema or speech disorder in NSCH 2003–2004, NSCH 2007–2008, and NHIS 1997–2013. Binary logistic regression models were constructed with eczema or speech disorder as the dependent variables and sex, age, race, household income, highest level of household education, US vs foreign birthplace, and insurance coverage as the independent variables. Because of differences in sampling methodology between NHIS and NSCH, sample weights could not be combined, and, thus, unweighted estimates of prevalence and effect size are presented.

The US pooled prevalence of speech disorder was found to be 2.4% (95% CI 2.4%–2.5%; Table IV). In bivariate logistic regression models, speech disorder was positively associated with African American race, Hispanic ethnicity, lower household income, and lower levels of household education. Speech disorder was inversely associated with female sex, older age, multiracial race, foreign birthplace, and lack of insurance coverage.
Association between Eczema and Speech Disorder

In bivariate models, eczema was significantly associated with speech disorder in 16 of 19 samples (P < .05, data not shown). In multivariate models adjusting for race/ethnicity, age, sex, household income, highest level of parental education, insurance coverage, US birthplace, lifetime history of asthma, and 1-year history of hay fever and food allergy, the association between eczema and speech disorder remained significant in 12 samples (Table V).

Binary logistic regression models were constructed with speech disorder as the dependent variable and eczema as the independent variable. Multivariate models included eczema, sex, age, race, household income, highest level of household education, US vs foreign birthplace, insurance coverage, ever history of asthma, and 1-year history of hay fever and food allergy as the independent variables. aORs and 95% CIs were estimated.

The pooled US prevalence of speech disorder was 4.7% (4.5%–5.0%) in children with eczema and 2.2% (2.2%–2.3%) in children without eczema (Table V). In pooled multivariate analysis, eczema was associated with significantly higher odds of speech disorder (pooled aOR [95% CI] using robust variance method, 1.81 [1.57–2.05], P < .001). Multivariate modeling of the pooled NHIS 1997–2013 data alone found eczema to be associated with significantly higher odds of speech disorder (1.71 [1.50–1.96], P < .001). Likewise, multivariate modeling of the pooled NSCH 2003–2004 and 2007–2008 data found eczema to be associated with significantly higher odds of speech disorder (1.53 [1.29–1.81], P < .001). The association between eczema and speech disorder occurred at all ages (aOR [95% CI] for 2–6 years: 1.73 [1.12–2.67], P = .01; 7–12 years: 1.50 [1.12–2.01], P = .007; 13–17 years: 1.90 [1.17–3.07], P = .009).

Analysis for confounders was performed by assessing each covariate separately with eczema as predictors of speech dysfunction in the years when the association did not remain significant in multivariate models. The association remained significant in 2013, 2007, 2003, and 1999 with the inclusion of every covariate individually, with the exception of the inclusion of asthma or digestive allergy for the year 2003. The association was not significant in 2011, 2009, and 2002 with the inclusion of the covariates individually.

The associations of eczema and outpatient healthcare visits as predictors of speech disorder were also examined for each sample. In 14 of 19 samples, the associations between eczema and speech disorder remained significant (P < .05) when adjusting for number of outpatient healthcare visits. The associations did not remain significant in the years 2002, 2003, 2007, 2009, and 2011.

A single interaction among the covariates of the 19-study pooled multivariate model was found between food allergy and eczema. In multivariate models, higher odds of speech disorder were found in children with eczema alone (1.71 [1.59–2.83], P < .001) and food allergy alone (1.99 [1.79–2.22], P < .001) compared with children without either condition. However, the highest odds of speech disorder were found in children with both eczema and food allergy (2.58 [2.27–2.93], P < .001).
Associations between Eczema and Speech Disorder Based on Severity

The 2007–2008 NSCH assessed the caregiver-reported severity of eczema. In multivariate models, mild eczema (1.36 [1.02–1.81], P = .03) and severe eczema (3.56 [1.70–7.48], P < .001) compared with no eczema were associated with significantly higher odds of speech disorders (Table VI). The 2007–2008 NSCH also assessed the caregiver-reported severity of speech disorder. In multivariate models, eczema was associated with significantly higher odds of moderate (2.35 [1.34–4.10], P = .003) and severe speech disorder (2.28 [1.11–4.72], P = .03) (Table VII).

Association between Eczema, Psychological and Sleep Disturbance, and Speech Disorder

Interactions between eczema and psychological and sleep disturbance were also examined as associations with speech disorder. The pooled prevalence of speech disorder in children and adolescents with either eczema (3.8% [3.6%–4.0%]) or ADD/ADHD (6.7% [6.4%–7.0%]) were higher than in those without either disorder (1.8% [1.8%–1.9%]). An even higher prevalence of speech disorder occurred in those with both eczema and ADHD (12.6% [11.4%–13.7%]). In pooled multivariate models, eczema (1.59 [1.47–1.71]) and ADD/ADHD (3.87 [3.61–4.14]) were associated with higher odds of speech disorder (Table VIII). However, children with both eczema and ADD/ADHD had even higher odds of speech disorder than either condition alone (6.00 [5.31–6.77]) (P < .001 for all).

Binary logistic regression models were constructed with speech disorder as the dependent variable. Eczema (NSCH 2003–2004 and 2007–2008 and NHIS 1997–2013), ADD/ADHD (NSCH 2003–2004 and 2007–2008 and NHIS 1997–2013), depression (NSCH 2007–2008 only), number of adequate nights of sleep per week (NSCH 2007–2008), insomnia (NHIS 2007 and 2012), daytime sleepiness (NHIS 2012), and fatigue (NHIS 2007 and 2012) were the independent variables. Multivariate models included sex, age, race, household income, highest level of household education, US vs foreign birthplace, insurance coverage, ever history of asthma, and 1-year history of hay fever and food allergy as the independent variables. aORs and 95% CIs were estimated.

In NSCH 2007–2008, eczema alone was associated with higher odds of speech disorder (1.58 [1.23–2.04], P < .001). Childhood depression with (3.10 [1.37–7.01], P = .006) and without (3.73 [2.45–5.68], P < .001) eczema had even higher odds of speech disorder.

In NSCH 2007–2008, 0–3 adequate nights of sleep alone (1.37 [1.00–1.87], P = .049) but not eczema alone (1.26 [0.94–1.70], P = .13) was associated with higher odds of speech disorder in multivariate models. However, children with both eczema and 0–3 adequate nights of sleep per week had dramatically higher odds of speech disorder (5.85 [2.72–12.53], P < .001).

In NHIS 2007 and 2012, eczema (1.70 [1.10–2.62], P = .02) and insomnia (4.43 [2.71–7.25], P < .001) were associated with higher odds of speech disorder in multivariate logistic regression models. However, children with both eczema and insomnia had even higher odds of speech disorder (5.93 [2.97–11.82], P < .001).

In NHIS 2012, eczema (1.86 [1.10–3.14], P = .02) but not caregiver-reported daytime sleepiness (2.18 [0.97–4.94], P = .06) was associated with higher odds of speech disorder in multivariate logistic regression models. However, children with both eczema and daytime sleepiness had dramatically increased odds of speech disorder (6.21 [2.44–15.80], P < .001).

In NHIS 2007 and 2012, eczema alone (1.82 [1.19–2.78], P = .006) was associated with higher odds of speech disorder. However, children with fatigue with (5.71 [2.77–12.17], P < .001) and without (5.68 [3.31–9.74], P < .001) eczema had even higher odds of speech disorder.

Discussion

In the present study, we analyzed data from 19 US population-based samples and found that pediatric eczema is associated with increased odds of speech disorder at all ages. In addition, our sociodemographic findings are consistent with previous studies showing higher risk for eczema in females,28–30 African Americans,1 and more highly educated families.1 In a single sample that assessed for eczema severity, severe eczema was associated with even higher odds of speech disorder than mild or moderate disease; mild disease was still also associated with increased speech disorder compared with children that had no eczema. Eczema was also associated with higher odds of moderate and severe speech disorder. Eczema without psychological and sleep dysfunction, including ADD/ADHD and depression was associated with modestly increased risk of speech disorder. However, eczema accompanied by these psychological diseases, fatigue, and sleep disturbance was associated with dramatically higher odds of speech disorder. Together, these results suggest that a subset of children with eczema have higher odds of speech disorder.

It is possible that children with eczema might have increased detection of speech disorders because of increased healthcare interaction. To address this, we created multivariate models that controlled for number of healthcare interactions and the association remained significant in 14 of 19 cohorts. Thus, we believe that these associations are not merely because of increased healthcare interaction. Regardless, increased utilization for speech disorders and other comorbidities in children with eczema13 may pose a previously unrecognized public-health health burden. Future longitudinal studies using clinical cohorts are needed to confirm these findings.

Several previous studies have examined possible interplay between eczema and speech disorder. A 2013 case-control study of 41 children examined the associations between sleep and neurocognitive function in children with eczema compared with children without eczema.31 Their investigation found that children with eczema had lower scores on all neurocognitive measures including verbal comprehension and word reasoning, though their testing did not specifically examine language functionality. Sleep architecture, assessed by parental report and polysomnography, did not significantly affect neurocognitive outcomes. Another previous study, assessing data from the 1995 Australian Health Survey on 12 388 children aged 0–14 years, examined the disease and socioeconomic associations of childhood speech disorders.32 Although their investigation found that children with speech disorders reported a higher number of comorbid health conditions than children without speech disorders, they found no significant difference in the prevalence of eczema between children with and children without speech disorders. Of note, they did not examine the relationship between speech disorders and eczema while controlling for sociodemographics and comorbid allergic disease nor did they examine any impact that sleep had on the development of speech disorders.

We theorize that the mechanism behind the association between eczema severity and speech disorder is likely multi-factorial, related to the effects of chronic disease during childhood development and chronic sleep deprivation. Sleep deprivation during the formative years of child development may interfere with the memory functions required for early language mastery.25,33 A 2007 study found that children with shorter sleep duration had 3.1 times the risk of low performance on a standardized vocabulary test, indicating a role for proper sleep duration in language acquisition.24 However, the present study demonstrates that although children with both eczema and sleep disturbance have vastly increased risk of speech disorder, even those with eczema and no sleep disturbance conditions had increased risk. It is possible that eczema, even without tangible complaints of sleep loss, inflicts developmental stress that impacts language development. It is also possible that eczema affects language development in the same manner of other childhood chronic disease. If so, it may be that other chronic disorders of childhood also increase the risk of speech disorder. Conversely, it could be that speech disorder occurs first in development and inflicts distress that increases a child’s predisposition toward itch and is eventually recognized as eczema.

This study has raised several additional questions about the relationship between speech disorder and eczema. Using a population-based experimental model, we could not determine the permanence of speech symptoms. Given that the association between eczema and speech disorder was significant even in adolescence, it is possible that language development is irreversibly altered by chronic eczema during early childhood. There appears to be a period of heightened sensitivity for language learning in children.34,35 Some studies have suggested that language learning declines after age 4 years, though the exact end point of this heightened sensitivity is unknown.34,35 It may be that eczema and/or other chronic diseases impair language learning during this critical period, potentially resulting in persistent language or speech deficits. Alternatively, it is possible that speech function is a reversible symptom of relapsing and remitting disease. If the latter is true, affected children may have no speech symptoms between eczema flares. We were also unable to determine if strong therapeutic control of a child’s eczema could in turn improve speech function or improvement in speech function with therapy could improve a child’s symptoms of itch. Longitudinal, prospective studies could elucidate these points.

The strengths of this study include using 19 US population-based surveys of children, each with minimal selection bias and a large sample size, encompassing children of all ages, races/ethnicities, and socioeconomic statuses. The associations remained significant in all 16 studies in bivariate analyses and 12 studies in multivariate or confounder analyses. It is not entirely clear why the association did not remain significant in 3 of 19 years. Nevertheless, the results demonstrate a highly reproducible association between eczema and speech disorder. In addition, the use of multivariate logistic regression models allowed us to adjust for confounding sociodemographic variables and comorbid allergic disease. However, our study is not without weakness. Speech disorder history was determined by caregiver-report of physician diagnosis in NSCH and caregiver-report in NHIS and not verified by a physician or speech pathologist. In addition, the NHIS question assessing for speech disorder inquired about only child history of “stuttering or stammering” and the NSCH question inquired about “stuttering, stammering, or other speech problems,” introducing heterogeneity among positive respondents of the different surveys. Eczema history was similarly determined by caregiver-report of physician diagnosis in NSCH and caregiver-report in NHIS and not verified by a physician. We recently performed a multicenter study to validate the question employed in NSCH and found very good sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value.36 Moreover, previous studies found good concordance between self-reported eczema and eczema diagnosed by medical examination.37,38 Thus, we believe that the case definition for eczema is valid. Finally, the cross-sectional design of our study prevents any conclusions from being made on causality. Perhaps there are unknown genetic or environmental factors that are responsible for both increased risk of sleep disturbance and problematic language development in certain eczema patients. Future prospective studies with objective determination of speech disorder and eczema severity could provide further information on precise etiology.

To determine if eczema is associated with an increased risk of a speech disorder.

We analyzed data on 354 416 children and adolescents from 19 US population-based cohorts: the 2003–2004 and 2007–2008 National Survey of Children’s Health and 1997–2013 National Health Interview Survey, each prospective, questionnaire-based cohorts.

In multivariate survey logistic regression models adjusting for sociodemographics and comorbid allergic disease, eczema was significantly associated with higher odds of speech disorder in 12 of 19 cohorts (P < .05). The pooled prevalence of speech disorder in children with eczema was 4.7% (95% CI 4.5%–5.0%) compared with 2.2% (95% CI 2.2%–2.3%) in children without eczema. In pooled multivariate analysis, eczema was associated with increased odds of speech disorder (aOR [95% CI] 1.81 [1.57–2.05], P < .001). In a single study assessing eczema severity, mild (1.36 [1.02–1.81], P = .03) and severe eczema (3.56 [1.70–7.48], P < .001) were associated with higher odds of speech disorder. History of eczema was associated with moderate (2.35 [1.34–4.10], P = .003) and severe (2.28 [1.11–4.72], P = .03) speech disorder. Finally, significant interactions were found, such that children with both eczema and attention deficit disorder with or without hyperactivity or sleep disturbance had vastly increased risk of speech disorders than either by itself.

Pediatric eczema may be associated with increased risk of speech disorder. Further, prospective studies are needed to characterize the exact nature of this association.

Eczema is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder with highest prevalence in childhood,1 which causes significant suffering because of itch, sleep disturbance,2 and decreased quality of life.3 Eczema is accompanied by profound systemic inflammation with activation of T-helper 2, 17, and 22 pathways.4–7 Systemic inflammation and/or the strong burden of atopic dermatitis may contribute toward a variety of health conditions. Indeed, we and other investigators have previously found childhood eczema to be associated with multiple comorbidities, including obesity,8–10 hypertension,10 low bone mineral density,11 increased risk of warts and extra-cutaneous infections,12 asthma,13 allergic rhinitis,13 attention deficit disorder (ADD)/attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),14,15 anxiety, depression, and conduct disorder.16,17

Many studies have reported on the negative neurocognitive outcomes of various chronic diseases of childhood, particularly language ability. For example, chronic otitis media,18,19 congenital heart disease,20 and chronic kidney disease21,22 have all have been associated with poor language and verbal performance in children. However, few studies have examined the neurocognitive ability of pediatric patients with eczema. Recently, we found that pediatric patients with eczema reported higher levels of contact with therapists, including speech therapists23 suggesting that eczema affects in some way the functional speech capability of children. Children with eczema have multiple risk factors for speech and language disorders, including sleep disturbance24,25 and ADHD.26 We hypothesized that eczema is independently associated with increased risk of speech problems in children, particularly in severe eczema, sleep disturbance, and comorbid ADHD. The present study analyzed 19 US population-based cohorts to determine whether there is an association between eczema and speech disorders.

Data were assessed from 19 different cohorts including the National Survey of Children’s Health (NSCH) 2003–2004 and 2007–2008 and the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) from the years 1997–2013. All surveys are collected by the National Center for Health Statistics, and the specific characteristics of each are reviewed (Table I; available at www.jpeds.com). In sampled households with multiple children, 1 child was randomly chosen to be the subject of the interview. Common to all samples is a multistage area probability sampling design that factors in age, sex, race, ethnicity, household size, and educational attainment of the most educated household member, using data from the US Census Bureau. Sample weights were created by the National Center for Health Statistics allowing for frequency and prevalence estimates that are representative of each state’s population of noninstitutionalized children. In this study, frequency and prevalence estimates presented in analyses of single samples reflect this complex weighting process. The similar sampling methodologies across the sample years allowed for weighted analysis of pooled results for NHIS (n = 17) and NSCH (n = 2), respectively. However, because of the differences in sampling methodology between NHIS and NSCH, sample weights for all 19 samples could not be combined in pooled analyses. Thus, in analyses of pooled weighted data of all 19 samples, meta-analysis of multivariate regression analysis effects were performed using a robust variance estimation method.27 This study was approved by the institutional review board at Northwestern University.

Survey characteristics

Associations of both pediatric eczema and speech disorder were examined in children aged 3–17 years from NHIS 1997–2013 and NSCH 2003 and children aged 2–17 years from NSCH 2007 including sex, age, race, household income, highest level of household/parental education, birthplace in the US, and insurance coverage.

Associations between caregiver-reported history of eczema (19 samples) and eczema severity (1 sample) and speech disorder were examined both for each individual cohort and in pooled analyses. Interactions between eczema and several comorbidities including ADD/ADHD, sleep disturbance, fatigue, and depression were examined for their effect on speech disorders. Contrast statements were used to determine the differential effect of each on the risk of speech disorder.

All data analyses and statistical processes were performed using the SURVEY procedures in SAS v 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina). Weighted population-based frequencies and prevalences were assessed for each study (PROC SURVEYFREQ). Multivariate survey logistic regression models were constructed for individual samples and pooled years of NSCH or NHIS accounting for the surveys’ complex weighting. The dependent variable in each model was the history of speech disorder in the past year. The independent variables were either 1-year history of eczema (ie, active eczema in the past year [yes/no] or eczema severity [no eczema/mild/moderate/severe]). Age (2–6/7–11/12–17 years), sex (male/female), race/ethnicity (non-His-panic Caucasian/non-Hispanic African American/Hispanic/multiracial or other), household income (0%–99%/100%–199%/200%–399%/400%+ federal poverty level), level of education of the highest member of the family/highest level of parental education (less than high school/high school or graduate equivalence degree/more than high school), insurance status (yes/no), birthplace (US/outside US), lifetime history of asthma (yes/no), and 1-year history of hay fever (yes/no) and digestive allergy (yes/no) were included as covariates. In addition, there was concern that diagnosis of comorbidity was related to overall increased healthcare utilization. Thus, a second multivariate model was created to examine the effect of eczema on speech disorder when controlling for number of outpatient visits per year. The aOR and 95% CI were determined. Two-way interactions between covariates were assessed and noted if significant (P < .01) and modified the effect size by ≥20%.

Our a priori hypothesis was that psychological and sleep dysfunction occurring in eczema is particularly associated with speech disorder. History of ADD/ADHD was assessed in all samples, whereas depression and number of nights of adequate sleep per week were assessed in NSCH 2007–2008. Fatigue and insomnia were assessed in NHIS 2007 and 2012, and daytime sleepiness was assessed in NHIS 2012 only. These variables and interaction terms with history of eczema were included in multivariate models. Estimates of effect size for significant interactions between the 2 variables were conducted for each level of the covariates using contrast statements. The various questions used in this study to assess eczema, speech disorder, depression, ADD/ADHD, and sleep disturbance are presented (Table II; available at www.jpeds.com).

Questions used in this study

Complete data analysis was performed in that subjects with missing data were excluded. The frequency of missing values from each study is presented (Table III; available at www.jpeds.com). Analysis of missing value patterns for speech disorder found that missing values were not more likely to occur in various age groups, racial and ethnic groups, family income levels, or education levels.

Data were analyzed on 354 416 US children and adolescents age 2–17 years, including those of all racial/ethnic groups, sex, levels of household income, and birthplaces. The pooled prevalence of eczema from all 19 samples was 10.1% (95% CI 10.0%–10.2%) (Table IV; available at www.jpeds.com). In pooled, bivariate logistic regression models, eczema was positively associated with female sex, and African American and multiracial race. In contrast, eczema was inversely associated with older age (7–11 years, 12–17 years), Hispanic ethnicity, less than high school level of household education, foreign birthplace, and lack of insurance coverage.

Pooled prevalence of eczema or speech disorder in NSCH 2003–2004, NSCH 2007–2008, and NHIS 1997–2013. Binary logistic regression models were constructed with eczema or speech disorder as the dependent variables and sex, age, race, household income, highest level of household education, US vs foreign birthplace, and insurance coverage as the independent variables. Because of differences in sampling methodology between NHIS and NSCH, sample weights could not be combined, and, thus, unweighted estimates of prevalence and effect size are presented.

The US pooled prevalence of speech disorder was found to be 2.4% (95% CI 2.4%–2.5%; Table IV). In bivariate logistic regression models, speech disorder was positively associated with African American race, Hispanic ethnicity, lower household income, and lower levels of household education. Speech disorder was inversely associated with female sex, older age, multiracial race, foreign birthplace, and lack of insurance coverage.

In bivariate models, eczema was significantly associated with speech disorder in 16 of 19 samples (P < .05, data not shown). In multivariate models adjusting for race/ethnicity, age, sex, household income, highest level of parental education, insurance coverage, US birthplace, lifetime history of asthma, and 1-year history of hay fever and food allergy, the association between eczema and speech disorder remained significant in 12 samples (Table V).

Binary logistic regression models were constructed with speech disorder as the dependent variable and eczema as the independent variable. Multivariate models included eczema, sex, age, race, household income, highest level of household education, US vs foreign birthplace, insurance coverage, ever history of asthma, and 1-year history of hay fever and food allergy as the independent variables. aORs and 95% CIs were estimated.

The pooled US prevalence of speech disorder was 4.7% (4.5%–5.0%) in children with eczema and 2.2% (2.2%–2.3%) in children without eczema (Table V). In pooled multivariate analysis, eczema was associated with significantly higher odds of speech disorder (pooled aOR [95% CI] using robust variance method, 1.81 [1.57–2.05], P < .001). Multivariate modeling of the pooled NHIS 1997–2013 data alone found eczema to be associated with significantly higher odds of speech disorder (1.71 [1.50–1.96], P < .001). Likewise, multivariate modeling of the pooled NSCH 2003–2004 and 2007–2008 data found eczema to be associated with significantly higher odds of speech disorder (1.53 [1.29–1.81], P < .001). The association between eczema and speech disorder occurred at all ages (aOR [95% CI] for 2–6 years: 1.73 [1.12–2.67], P = .01; 7–12 years: 1.50 [1.12–2.01], P = .007; 13–17 years: 1.90 [1.17–3.07], P = .009).

Analysis for confounders was performed by assessing each covariate separately with eczema as predictors of speech dysfunction in the years when the association did not remain significant in multivariate models. The association remained significant in 2013, 2007, 2003, and 1999 with the inclusion of every covariate individually, with the exception of the inclusion of asthma or digestive allergy for the year 2003. The association was not significant in 2011, 2009, and 2002 with the inclusion of the covariates individually.

The associations of eczema and outpatient healthcare visits as predictors of speech disorder were also examined for each sample. In 14 of 19 samples, the associations between eczema and speech disorder remained significant (P < .05) when adjusting for number of outpatient healthcare visits. The associations did not remain significant in the years 2002, 2003, 2007, 2009, and 2011.

A single interaction among the covariates of the 19-study pooled multivariate model was found between food allergy and eczema. In multivariate models, higher odds of speech disorder were found in children with eczema alone (1.71 [1.59–2.83], P < .001) and food allergy alone (1.99 [1.79–2.22], P < .001) compared with children without either condition. However, the highest odds of speech disorder were found in children with both eczema and food allergy (2.58 [2.27–2.93], P < .001).

The 2007–2008 NSCH assessed the caregiver-reported severity of eczema. In multivariate models, mild eczema (1.36 [1.02–1.81], P = .03) and severe eczema (3.56 [1.70–7.48], P < .001) compared with no eczema were associated with significantly higher odds of speech disorders (Table VI). The 2007–2008 NSCH also assessed the caregiver-reported severity of speech disorder. In multivariate models, eczema was associated with significantly higher odds of moderate (2.35 [1.34–4.10], P = .003) and severe speech disorder (2.28 [1.11–4.72], P = .03) (Table VII).

Interactions between eczema and psychological and sleep disturbance were also examined as associations with speech disorder. The pooled prevalence of speech disorder in children and adolescents with either eczema (3.8% [3.6%–4.0%]) or ADD/ADHD (6.7% [6.4%–7.0%]) were higher than in those without either disorder (1.8% [1.8%–1.9%]). An even higher prevalence of speech disorder occurred in those with both eczema and ADHD (12.6% [11.4%–13.7%]). In pooled multivariate models, eczema (1.59 [1.47–1.71]) and ADD/ADHD (3.87 [3.61–4.14]) were associated with higher odds of speech disorder (Table VIII). However, children with both eczema and ADD/ADHD had even higher odds of speech disorder than either condition alone (6.00 [5.31–6.77]) (P < .001 for all).

Association between eczema, psychiatric or sleep disturbance, and speech disorder

Ref, reference.

Binary logistic regression models were constructed with speech disorder as the dependent variable. Eczema (NSCH 2003–2004 and 2007–2008 and NHIS 1997–2013), ADD/ADHD (NSCH 2003–2004 and 2007–2008 and NHIS 1997–2013), depression (NSCH 2007–2008 only), number of adequate nights of sleep per week (NSCH 2007–2008), insomnia (NHIS 2007 and 2012), daytime sleepiness (NHIS 2012), and fatigue (NHIS 2007 and 2012) were the independent variables. Multivariate models included sex, age, race, household income, highest level of household education, US vs foreign birthplace, insurance coverage, ever history of asthma, and 1-year history of hay fever and food allergy as the independent variables. aORs and 95% CIs were estimated.

In NSCH 2007–2008, eczema alone was associated with higher odds of speech disorder (1.58 [1.23–2.04], P < .001). Childhood depression with (3.10 [1.37–7.01], P = .006) and without (3.73 [2.45–5.68], P < .001) eczema had even higher odds of speech disorder.

In NSCH 2007–2008, 0–3 adequate nights of sleep alone (1.37 [1.00–1.87], P = .049) but not eczema alone (1.26 [0.94–1.70], P = .13) was associated with higher odds of speech disorder in multivariate models. However, children with both eczema and 0–3 adequate nights of sleep per week had dramatically higher odds of speech disorder (5.85 [2.72–12.53], P < .001).

In NHIS 2007 and 2012, eczema (1.70 [1.10–2.62], P = .02) and insomnia (4.43 [2.71–7.25], P < .001) were associated with higher odds of speech disorder in multivariate logistic regression models. However, children with both eczema and insomnia had even higher odds of speech disorder (5.93 [2.97–11.82], P < .001).

In NHIS 2012, eczema (1.86 [1.10–3.14], P = .02) but not caregiver-reported daytime sleepiness (2.18 [0.97–4.94], P = .06) was associated with higher odds of speech disorder in multivariate logistic regression models. However, children with both eczema and daytime sleepiness had dramatically increased odds of speech disorder (6.21 [2.44–15.80], P < .001).

In NHIS 2007 and 2012, eczema alone (1.82 [1.19–2.78], P = .006) was associated with higher odds of speech disorder. However, children with fatigue with (5.71 [2.77–12.17], P < .001) and without (5.68 [3.31–9.74], P < .001) eczema had even higher odds of speech disorder.

In the present study, we analyzed data from 19 US population-based samples and found that pediatric eczema is associated with increased odds of speech disorder at all ages. In addition, our sociodemographic findings are consistent with previous studies showing higher risk for eczema in females,28–30 African Americans,1 and more highly educated families.1 In a single sample that assessed for eczema severity, severe eczema was associated with even higher odds of speech disorder than mild or moderate disease; mild disease was still also associated with increased speech disorder compared with children that had no eczema. Eczema was also associated with higher odds of moderate and severe speech disorder. Eczema without psychological and sleep dysfunction, including ADD/ADHD and depression was associated with modestly increased risk of speech disorder. However, eczema accompanied by these psychological diseases, fatigue, and sleep disturbance was associated with dramatically higher odds of speech disorder. Together, these results suggest that a subset of children with eczema have higher odds of speech disorder.

It is possible that children with eczema might have increased detection of speech disorders because of increased healthcare interaction. To address this, we created multivariate models that controlled for number of healthcare interactions and the association remained significant in 14 of 19 cohorts. Thus, we believe that these associations are not merely because of increased healthcare interaction. Regardless, increased utilization for speech disorders and other comorbidities in children with eczema13 may pose a previously unrecognized public-health health burden. Future longitudinal studies using clinical cohorts are needed to confirm these findings.

Several previous studies have examined possible interplay between eczema and speech disorder. A 2013 case-control study of 41 children examined the associations between sleep and neurocognitive function in children with eczema compared with children without eczema.31 Their investigation found that children with eczema had lower scores on all neurocognitive measures including verbal comprehension and word reasoning, though their testing did not specifically examine language functionality. Sleep architecture, assessed by parental report and polysomnography, did not significantly affect neurocognitive outcomes. Another previous study, assessing data from the 1995 Australian Health Survey on 12 388 children aged 0–14 years, examined the disease and socioeconomic associations of childhood speech disorders.32 Although their investigation found that children with speech disorders reported a higher number of comorbid health conditions than children without speech disorders, they found no significant difference in the prevalence of eczema between children with and children without speech disorders. Of note, they did not examine the relationship between speech disorders and eczema while controlling for sociodemographics and comorbid allergic disease nor did they examine any impact that sleep had on the development of speech disorders.

We theorize that the mechanism behind the association between eczema severity and speech disorder is likely multi-factorial, related to the effects of chronic disease during childhood development and chronic sleep deprivation. Sleep deprivation during the formative years of child development may interfere with the memory functions required for early language mastery.25,33 A 2007 study found that children with shorter sleep duration had 3.1 times the risk of low performance on a standardized vocabulary test, indicating a role for proper sleep duration in language acquisition.24 However, the present study demonstrates that although children with both eczema and sleep disturbance have vastly increased risk of speech disorder, even those with eczema and no sleep disturbance conditions had increased risk. It is possible that eczema, even without tangible complaints of sleep loss, inflicts developmental stress that impacts language development. It is also possible that eczema affects language development in the same manner of other childhood chronic disease. If so, it may be that other chronic disorders of childhood also increase the risk of speech disorder. Conversely, it could be that speech disorder occurs first in development and inflicts distress that increases a child’s predisposition toward itch and is eventually recognized as eczema.

Children with eczema have multiple risk factors for speech and language disorders, including sleep disturbance24,25 and ADHD.26 We hypothesized that eczema is independently associated with increased risk of speech problems in children, particularly in severe eczema, sleep disturbance, and comorbid ADHD. The present study analyzed 19 US population-based cohorts to determine whether there is an association between eczema and speech disorders.

Data were assessed from 19 different cohorts including the National Survey of Children’s Health (NSCH) 2003–2004 and 2007–2008 and the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) from the years 1997–2013. All surveys are collected by the National Center for Health Statistics, and the specific characteristics of each are reviewed (Table I; available at www.jpeds.com). In sampled households with multiple children, 1 child was randomly chosen to be the subject of the interview. Common to all samples is a multistage area probability sampling design that factors in age, sex, race, ethnicity, household size, and educational attainment of the most educated household member, using data from the US Census Bureau. Sample weights were created by the National Center for Health Statistics allowing for frequency and prevalence estimates that are representative of each state’s population of noninstitutionalized children. In this study, frequency and prevalence estimates presented in analyses of single samples reflect this complex weighting process. The similar sampling methodologies across the sample years allowed for weighted analysis of pooled results for NHIS (n = 17) and NSCH (n = 2), respectively. However, because of the differences in sampling methodology between NHIS and NSCH, sample weights for all 19 samples could not be combined in pooled analyses. Thus, in analyses of pooled weighted data of all 19 samples, meta-analysis of multivariate regression analysis effects were performed using a robust variance estimation method.27 This study was approved by the institutional review board at Northwestern University.

Survey characteristics

Associations of both pediatric eczema and speech disorder were examined in children aged 3–17 years from NHIS 1997–2013 and NSCH 2003 and children aged 2–17 years from NSCH 2007 including sex, age, race, household income, highest level of household/parental education, birthplace in the US, and insurance coverage.

Associations between caregiver-reported history of eczema (19 samples) and eczema severity (1 sample) and speech disorder were examined both for each individual cohort and in pooled analyses. Interactions between eczema and several comorbidities including ADD/ADHD, sleep disturbance, fatigue, and depression were examined for their effect on speech disorders. Contrast statements were used to determine the differential effect of each on the risk of speech disorder.

All data analyses and statistical processes were performed using the SURVEY procedures in SAS v 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina). Weighted population-based frequencies and prevalences were assessed for each study (PROC SURVEYFREQ). Multivariate survey logistic regression models were constructed for individual samples and pooled years of NSCH or NHIS accounting for the surveys’ complex weighting. The dependent variable in each model was the history of speech disorder in the past year. The independent variables were either 1-year history of eczema (ie, active eczema in the past year [yes/no] or eczema severity [no eczema/mild/moderate/severe]). Age (2–6/7–11/12–17 years), sex (male/female), race/ethnicity (non-His-panic Caucasian/non-Hispanic African American/Hispanic/multiracial or other), household income (0%–99%/100%–199%/200%–399%/400%+ federal poverty level), level of education of the highest member of the family/highest level of parental education (less than high school/high school or graduate equivalence degree/more than high school), insurance status (yes/no), birthplace (US/outside US), lifetime history of asthma (yes/no), and 1-year history of hay fever (yes/no) and digestive allergy (yes/no) were included as covariates. In addition, there was concern that diagnosis of comorbidity was related to overall increased healthcare utilization. Thus, a second multivariate model was created to examine the effect of eczema on speech disorder when controlling for number of outpatient visits per year. The aOR and 95% CI were determined. Two-way interactions between covariates were assessed and noted if significant (P < .01) and modified the effect size by ≥20%.

Our a priori hypothesis was that psychological and sleep dysfunction occurring in eczema is particularly associated with speech disorder. History of ADD/ADHD was assessed in all samples, whereas depression and number of nights of adequate sleep per week were assessed in NSCH 2007–2008. Fatigue and insomnia were assessed in NHIS 2007 and 2012, and daytime sleepiness was assessed in NHIS 2012 only. These variables and interaction terms with history of eczema were included in multivariate models. Estimates of effect size for significant interactions between the 2 variables were conducted for each level of the covariates using contrast statements. The various questions used in this study to assess eczema, speech disorder, depression, ADD/ADHD, and sleep disturbance are presented (Table II; available at www.jpeds.com).

Questions used in this study

Complete data analysis was performed in that subjects with missing data were excluded. The frequency of missing values from each study is presented (Table III; available at www.jpeds.com). Analysis of missing value patterns for speech disorder found that missing values were not more likely to occur in various age groups, racial and ethnic groups, family income levels, or education levels.

Data were analyzed on 354 416 US children and adolescents age 2–17 years, including those of all racial/ethnic groups, sex, levels of household income, and birthplaces. The pooled prevalence of eczema from all 19 samples was 10.1% (95% CI 10.0%–10.2%) (Table IV; available at www.jpeds.com). In pooled, bivariate logistic regression models, eczema was positively associated with female sex, and African American and multiracial race. In contrast, eczema was inversely associated with older age (7–11 years, 12–17 years), Hispanic ethnicity, less than high school level of household education, foreign birthplace, and lack of insurance coverage.

Pooled prevalence of eczema or speech disorder in NSCH 2003–2004, NSCH 2007–2008, and NHIS 1997–2013. Binary logistic regression models were constructed with eczema or speech disorder as the dependent variables and sex, age, race, household income, highest level of household education, US vs foreign birthplace, and insurance coverage as the independent variables. Because of differences in sampling methodology between NHIS and NSCH, sample weights could not be combined, and, thus, unweighted estimates of prevalence and effect size are presented.

The US pooled prevalence of speech disorder was found to be 2.4% (95% CI 2.4%–2.5%; Table IV). In bivariate logistic regression models, speech disorder was positively associated with African American race, Hispanic ethnicity, lower household income, and lower levels of household education. Speech disorder was inversely associated with female sex, older age, multiracial race, foreign birthplace, and lack of insurance coverage.

In bivariate models, eczema was significantly associated with speech disorder in 16 of 19 samples (P < .05, data not shown). In multivariate models adjusting for race/ethnicity, age, sex, household income, highest level of parental education, insurance coverage, US birthplace, lifetime history of asthma, and 1-year history of hay fever and food allergy, the association between eczema and speech disorder remained significant in 12 samples (Table V).

Binary logistic regression models were constructed with speech disorder as the dependent variable and eczema as the independent variable. Multivariate models included eczema, sex, age, race, household income, highest level of household education, US vs foreign birthplace, insurance coverage, ever history of asthma, and 1-year history of hay fever and food allergy as the independent variables. aORs and 95% CIs were estimated.

The pooled US prevalence of speech disorder was 4.7% (4.5%–5.0%) in children with eczema and 2.2% (2.2%–2.3%) in children without eczema (Table V). In pooled multivariate analysis, eczema was associated with significantly higher odds of speech disorder (pooled aOR [95% CI] using robust variance method, 1.81 [1.57–2.05], P < .001). Multivariate modeling of the pooled NHIS 1997–2013 data alone found eczema to be associated with significantly higher odds of speech disorder (1.71 [1.50–1.96], P < .001). Likewise, multivariate modeling of the pooled NSCH 2003–2004 and 2007–2008 data found eczema to be associated with significantly higher odds of speech disorder (1.53 [1.29–1.81], P < .001). The association between eczema and speech disorder occurred at all ages (aOR [95% CI] for 2–6 years: 1.73 [1.12–2.67], P = .01; 7–12 years: 1.50 [1.12–2.01], P = .007; 13–17 years: 1.90 [1.17–3.07], P = .009).

Analysis for confounders was performed by assessing each covariate separately with eczema as predictors of speech dysfunction in the years when the association did not remain significant in multivariate models. The association remained significant in 2013, 2007, 2003, and 1999 with the inclusion of every covariate individually, with the exception of the inclusion of asthma or digestive allergy for the year 2003. The association was not significant in 2011, 2009, and 2002 with the inclusion of the covariates individually.

The associations of eczema and outpatient healthcare visits as predictors of speech disorder were also examined for each sample. In 14 of 19 samples, the associations between eczema and speech disorder remained significant (P < .05) when adjusting for number of outpatient healthcare visits. The associations did not remain significant in the years 2002, 2003, 2007, 2009, and 2011.

A single interaction among the covariates of the 19-study pooled multivariate model was found between food allergy and eczema. In multivariate models, higher odds of speech disorder were found in children with eczema alone (1.71 [1.59–2.83], P < .001) and food allergy alone (1.99 [1.79–2.22], P < .001) compared with children without either condition. However, the highest odds of speech disorder were found in children with both eczema and food allergy (2.58 [2.27–2.93], P < .001).

The 2007–2008 NSCH assessed the caregiver-reported severity of eczema. In multivariate models, mild eczema (1.36 [1.02–1.81], P = .03) and severe eczema (3.56 [1.70–7.48], P < .001) compared with no eczema were associated with significantly higher odds of speech disorders (Table VI). The 2007–2008 NSCH also assessed the caregiver-reported severity of speech disorder. In multivariate models, eczema was associated with significantly higher odds of moderate (2.35 [1.34–4.10], P = .003) and severe speech disorder (2.28 [1.11–4.72], P = .03) (Table VII).

Interactions between eczema and psychological and sleep disturbance were also examined as associations with speech disorder. The pooled prevalence of speech disorder in children and adolescents with either eczema (3.8% [3.6%–4.0%]) or ADD/ADHD (6.7% [6.4%–7.0%]) were higher than in those without either disorder (1.8% [1.8%–1.9%]). An even higher prevalence of speech disorder occurred in those with both eczema and ADHD (12.6% [11.4%–13.7%]). In pooled multivariate models, eczema (1.59 [1.47–1.71]) and ADD/ADHD (3.87 [3.61–4.14]) were associated with higher odds of speech disorder (Table VIII). However, children with both eczema and ADD/ADHD had even higher odds of speech disorder than either condition alone (6.00 [5.31–6.77]) (P < .001 for all).

Association between eczema, psychiatric or sleep disturbance, and speech disorder

Ref, reference.

Binary logistic regression models were constructed with speech disorder as the dependent variable. Eczema (NSCH 2003–2004 and 2007–2008 and NHIS 1997–2013), ADD/ADHD (NSCH 2003–2004 and 2007–2008 and NHIS 1997–2013), depression (NSCH 2007–2008 only), number of adequate nights of sleep per week (NSCH 2007–2008), insomnia (NHIS 2007 and 2012), daytime sleepiness (NHIS 2012), and fatigue (NHIS 2007 and 2012) were the independent variables. Multivariate models included sex, age, race, household income, highest level of household education, US vs foreign birthplace, insurance coverage, ever history of asthma, and 1-year history of hay fever and food allergy as the independent variables. aORs and 95% CIs were estimated.

In NSCH 2007–2008, eczema alone was associated with higher odds of speech disorder (1.58 [1.23–2.04], P < .001). Childhood depression with (3.10 [1.37–7.01], P = .006) and without (3.73 [2.45–5.68], P < .001) eczema had even higher odds of speech disorder.

In NSCH 2007–2008, 0–3 adequate nights of sleep alone (1.37 [1.00–1.87], P = .049) but not eczema alone (1.26 [0.94–1.70], P = .13) was associated with higher odds of speech disorder in multivariate models. However, children with both eczema and 0–3 adequate nights of sleep per week had dramatically higher odds of speech disorder (5.85 [2.72–12.53], P < .001).

In NHIS 2007 and 2012, eczema (1.70 [1.10–2.62], P = .02) and insomnia (4.43 [2.71–7.25], P < .001) were associated with higher odds of speech disorder in multivariate logistic regression models. However, children with both eczema and insomnia had even higher odds of speech disorder (5.93 [2.97–11.82], P < .001).

In NHIS 2012, eczema (1.86 [1.10–3.14], P = .02) but not caregiver-reported daytime sleepiness (2.18 [0.97–4.94], P = .06) was associated with higher odds of speech disorder in multivariate logistic regression models. However, children with both eczema and daytime sleepiness had dramatically increased odds of speech disorder (6.21 [2.44–15.80], P < .001).

In NHIS 2007 and 2012, eczema alone (1.82 [1.19–2.78], P = .006) was associated with higher odds of speech disorder. However, children with fatigue with (5.71 [2.77–12.17], P < .001) and without (5.68 [3.31–9.74], P < .001) eczema had even higher odds of speech disorder.

In the present study, we analyzed data from 19 US population-based samples and found that pediatric eczema is associated with increased odds of speech disorder at all ages. In addition, our sociodemographic findings are consistent with previous studies showing higher risk for eczema in females,28–30 African Americans,1 and more highly educated families.1 In a single sample that assessed for eczema severity, severe eczema was associated with even higher odds of speech disorder than mild or moderate disease; mild disease was still also associated with increased speech disorder compared with children that had no eczema. Eczema was also associated with higher odds of moderate and severe speech disorder. Eczema without psychological and sleep dysfunction, including ADD/ADHD and depression was associated with modestly increased risk of speech disorder. However, eczema accompanied by these psychological diseases, fatigue, and sleep disturbance was associated with dramatically higher odds of speech disorder. Together, these results suggest that a subset of children with eczema have higher odds of speech disorder.

It is possible that children with eczema might have increased detection of speech disorders because of increased healthcare interaction. To address this, we created multivariate models that controlled for number of healthcare interactions and the association remained significant in 14 of 19 cohorts. Thus, we believe that these associations are not merely because of increased healthcare interaction. Regardless, increased utilization for speech disorders and other comorbidities in children with eczema13 may pose a previously unrecognized public-health health burden. Future longitudinal studies using clinical cohorts are needed to confirm these findings.

Several previous studies have examined possible interplay between eczema and speech disorder. A 2013 case-control study of 41 children examined the associations between sleep and neurocognitive function in children with eczema compared with children without eczema.31 Their investigation found that children with eczema had lower scores on all neurocognitive measures including verbal comprehension and word reasoning, though their testing did not specifically examine language functionality. Sleep architecture, assessed by parental report and polysomnography, did not significantly affect neurocognitive outcomes. Another previous study, assessing data from the 1995 Australian Health Survey on 12 388 children aged 0–14 years, examined the disease and socioeconomic associations of childhood speech disorders.32 Although their investigation found that children with speech disorders reported a higher number of comorbid health conditions than children without speech disorders, they found no significant difference in the prevalence of eczema between children with and children without speech disorders. Of note, they did not examine the relationship between speech disorders and eczema while controlling for sociodemographics and comorbid allergic disease nor did they examine any impact that sleep had on the development of speech disorders.

We theorize that the mechanism behind the association between eczema severity and speech disorder is likely multi-factorial, related to the effects of chronic disease during childhood development and chronic sleep deprivation. Sleep deprivation during the formative years of child development may interfere with the memory functions required for early language mastery.25,33 A 2007 study found that children with shorter sleep duration had 3.1 times the risk of low performance on a standardized vocabulary test, indicating a role for proper sleep duration in language acquisition.24 However, the present study demonstrates that although children with both eczema and sleep disturbance have vastly increased risk of speech disorder, even those with eczema and no sleep disturbance conditions had increased risk. It is possible that eczema, even without tangible complaints of sleep loss, inflicts developmental stress that impacts language development. It is also possible that eczema affects language development in the same manner of other childhood chronic disease. If so, it may be that other chronic disorders of childhood also increase the risk of speech disorder. Conversely, it could be that speech disorder occurs first in development and inflicts distress that increases a child’s predisposition toward itch and is eventually recognized as eczema.

This study has raised several additional questions about the relationship between speech disorder and eczema. Using a population-based experimental model, we could not determine the permanence of speech symptoms. Given that the association between eczema and speech disorder was significant even in adolescence, it is possible that language development is irreversibly altered by chronic eczema during early childhood. There appears to be a period of heightened sensitivity for language learning in children.34,35 Some studies have suggested that language learning declines after age 4 years, though the exact end point of this heightened sensitivity is unknown.34,35 It may be that eczema and/or other chronic diseases impair language learning during this critical period, potentially resulting in persistent language or speech deficits. Alternatively, it is possible that speech function is a reversible symptom of relapsing and remitting disease. If the latter is true, affected children may have no speech symptoms between eczema flares. We were also unable to determine if strong therapeutic control of a child’s eczema could in turn improve speech function or improvement in speech function with therapy could improve a child’s symptoms of itch. Longitudinal, prospective studies could elucidate these points.

The strengths of this study include using 19 US population-based surveys of children, each with minimal selection bias and a large sample size, encompassing children of all ages, races/ethnicities, and socioeconomic statuses. The associations remained significant in all 16 studies in bivariate analyses and 12 studies in multivariate or confounder analyses. It is not entirely clear why the association did not remain significant in 3 of 19 years. Nevertheless, the results demonstrate a highly reproducible association between eczema and speech disorder. In addition, the use of multivariate logistic regression models allowed us to adjust for confounding sociodemographic variables and comorbid allergic disease. However, our study is not without weakness. Speech disorder history was determined by caregiver-report of physician diagnosis in NSCH and caregiver-report in NHIS and not verified by a physician or speech pathologist. In addition, the NHIS question assessing for speech disorder inquired about only child history of “stuttering or stammering” and the NSCH question inquired about “stuttering, stammering, or other speech problems,” introducing heterogeneity among positive respondents of the different surveys. Eczema history was similarly determined by caregiver-report of physician diagnosis in NSCH and caregiver-report in NHIS and not verified by a physician. We recently performed a multicenter study to validate the question employed in NSCH and found very good sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value.36 Moreover, previous studies found good concordance between self-reported eczema and eczema diagnosed by medical examination.37,38 Thus, we believe that the case definition for eczema is valid. Finally, the cross-sectional design of our study prevents any conclusions from being made on causality. Perhaps there are unknown genetic or environmental factors that are responsible for both increased risk of sleep disturbance and problematic language development in certain eczema patients. Future prospective studies with objective determination of speech disorder and eczema severity could provide further information on precise etiology.
