<HEADER ID='H-0'> Introduction </HEADER>
<P>
<S ID='S-0' AZ='BKG'> In the course of developing natural language interfaces , computational linguists are often in the position of evaluating different theoretical approaches to the analysis of natural language ( NL ) . </S>
<S ID='S-1' AZ='BKG' TYPE='ITEM'> They might want to </S>
<S ID='S-2' TYPE='ITEM' AZ='BKG'> evaluate and improve on a current system , </S>
<S ID='S-3' TYPE='ITEM' AZ='BKG'> add a capability to a system that it didn't previously have , </S>
<S ID='S-4' TYPE='ITEM' AZ='BKG'> combine modules from different systems . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-5' AZ='BKG'> Consider the goal of adding a discourse component to a system , or evaluating and improving one that is already in place . </S>
<S ID='S-6' AZ='OTH'> A discourse module might combine theories on , e.g. , centering or local focusing <REF TYPE='P'>Grosz et al. 1983</REF> , <REF TYPE='P'>Sidner 1979</REF> , global focus <REF TYPE='P'>Grosz 1977</REF> , coherence relations <REF TYPE='P'>Hobbs 1985</REF> , event reference <REF TYPE='P'>Webber 1986</REF> , intonational structure <REF TYPE='P'>Pierrehumbert and Hirschberg 1990</REF> , system vs. user beliefs <REF TYPE='P'>Pollack 1986</REF> , plan or intent recognition or production <REF TYPE='P'>Cohen 1978</REF> , <REF TYPE='P'>Allen and Perrault 1980</REF> , <REF TYPE='P'>Sidner and Israel 1981</REF> , control <REF TYPE='P'>Whittaker and Stenton 1988</REF> , or complex syntactic structures <REF TYPE='P'>Prince 1985</REF> . </S>
<S ID='S-7' AZ='AIM'> How might one evaluate the relative contributions of each of these factors or compare two approaches to the same problem ? </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-8' ABSTRACTC='A-0' AZ='AIM'> In order to take steps towards establishing a methodology for doing this type of comparison , we conducted a case study . </S>
<S ID='S-9' ABSTRACTC='A-1' AZ='AIM'> We attempt to evaluate two different approaches to anaphoric processing in discourse by comparing the accuracy and coverage of two published algorithms for finding the co-specifiers of pronouns in naturally occurring texts and dialogues <REF  TYPE='P'>Hobbs 1976b</REF>, <REF  SELF="YES" TYPE='P'>Brennan et al. 1987</REF> . </S>
<S ID='S-10' AZ='OWN'> Thus there are two parts to this paper : we present the quantitative results of hand-simulating these algorithms ( henceforth <REFAUTHOR>Hobbs</REFAUTHOR> algorithm and <REFAUTHOR SELF="YES">Brennan et al.</REFAUTHOR> algorithm ) , but this analysis naturally gives rise to both a qualitative evaluation and recommendations for performing such evaluations in general . </S>
<S ID='S-11' ABSTRACTC='A-3' AZ='OWN'> We illustrate the general difficulties encountered with quantitative evaluation . </S>
<S ID='S-12' ABSTRACTC='A-4' AZ='OWN' TYPE='ITEM'> These are problems with : </S>
<S ID='S-13' ABSTRACTC='A-5' TYPE='ITEM' AZ='OWN' > allowing for underlying assumptions , </S>
<S ID='S-14' ABSTRACTC='A-6' TYPE='ITEM' AZ='OWN' > determining how to handle underspecifications , and </S>
<S ID='S-15' ABSTRACTC='A-7' TYPE='ITEM' AZ='OWN' > evaluating the contribution of false positives and error chaining . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-16' AZ='OWN'> Although both algorithms are part of theories of discourse that posit the interaction of the algorithm with an inference or intentional component , we will not use reasoning in tandem with the algorithm 's operation . </S>
<S ID='S-17' AZ='OWN'> We have made this choice because we want to be able to analyse the performance of the algorithms across different domains . </S>
<S ID='S-18' AZ='OWN'> We focus on the linguistic basis of these approaches , using only selectional restrictions , so that our analysis is independent of the vagaries of a particular knowledge representation . </S>
<S ID='S-19' AZ='OWN'> Thus what we are evaluating is the extent to which these algorithms suffice to narrow the search of an inference component . </S>
<S ID='S-20' AZ='OWN'> This analysis gives us some indication of the contribution of syntactic constraints , task structure and global focus to anaphoric processing . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-21' AZ='OWN'> The data on which we compare the algorithms are important if we are to evaluate claims of generality . </S>
<S ID='S-22' AZ='OWN'> If we look at types of NL input , one clear division is between textual and interactive input . </S>
<S ID='S-23' AZ='OWN'> A related , though not identical factor is whether the language being analysed is produced by more than one person , although this distinction may be conflated in textual material such as novels that contain reported conversations . </S>
<S ID='S-24' AZ='OWN'> Within two-person interactive dialogues , there are the task-oriented master-slave type , where all the expertise and hence much of the initiative , rests with one person . </S>
<S ID='S-25' AZ='OWN'> In other two-person dialogues , both parties may contribute discourse entities to the conversation on a more equal basis . </S>
<S ID='S-26' AZ='OWN'> Other factors of interest are whether the dialogues are human-to-human or human-to-computer , as well as the modality of communication , e.g. spoken or typed , since some researchers have indicated that dialogues , and particularly uses of reference within them , vary along these dimensions <REF TYPE='P'>Cohen 1984</REF> , <REF TYPE='P'>Henisz Thompson 1980</REF> , <REF TYPE='P'>Guindon et al. 1986</REF> , <REF  TYPE='P'>Dahlbach and Johnson 1989</REF>, <REF  TYPE='P'>Whittaker and Stenton 1989</REF> . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-27' AZ='OWN'> We analyse the performance of the algorithms on three types of data . </S>
<S ID='S-28' AZ='OWN'> Two of the samples are those that <REFAUTHOR>Hobbs</REFAUTHOR> used when developing his algorithm . </S>
<S ID='S-29' AZ='OWN'> One is an excerpt from a novel and the other a sample of journalistic writing . </S>
<S ID='S-30' AZ='OWN'> The remaining sample is a set of 5 human-human , keyboard-mediated , task-oriented dialogues about the assembly of a plastic water pump <REF TYPE='P'>Cohen 1984</REF> . </S>
<S ID='S-31' AZ='OWN'> This covers only a subset of the above types . </S>
<S ID='S-32' AZ='OWN'> Obviously it would be instructive to conduct a similar analysis on other textual types . </S>

<HEADER ID='H-2'> The Algorithms </HEADER>
<P>
<S ID='S-33' AZ='OWN'> When embarking on such a comparison , it would be convenient to assume that the inputs to the algorithms are identical and compare their outputs . </S>
<S ID='S-34' AZ='BKG'> Unfortunately since researchers do not even agree on which phenomena can be explained syntactically and which semantically , the boundaries between two modules are rarely the same in NL systems . </S>
<S ID='S-35' AZ='OWN'> In this case the <REFAUTHOR SELF="YES">Brennan et al.</REFAUTHOR> centering algorithm and <REFAUTHOR>Hobbs</REFAUTHOR> algorithm both make ASSUMPTIONS about other system components . </S>
<S ID='S-36' AZ='OWN'> These are , in some sense , a further specification of the operation of the algorithms that must be made in order to hand-simulate the algorithms . </S>
<S ID='S-37' AZ='OWN'> There are two major sets of assumptions , based on discourse segmentation and syntactic representation . </S>
<S ID='S-38' AZ='OWN'> We attempt to make these explicit for each algorithm and pinpoint where the algorithms might behave differently were these assumptions not well-founded . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-39' AZ='OWN'> In addition , there may be a number of UNDERSPECIFICATIONS in the descriptions of the algorithms . </S>
<S ID='S-40' AZ='OWN'> These often arise because theories that attempt to categorize naturally occurring data and algorithms based on them will always be prey to previously unencountered examples . </S>
<S ID='S-41' AZ='OTH'> For example , since the <REFAUTHOR SELF="YES">Brennan et al.</REFAUTHOR> salience hierarchy for discourse entities is based on grammatical relation , an implicit assumption is that an utterance only has one subject . </S>
<S ID='S-42' AZ='CTR'> However the novel Wheels has many examples of reported dialogue such as </S>
</P>
<EXAMPLE ID='E-0'>
<EX-S> She continued , unperturbed , `` Mr. Vale quotes the Bible about air pollution . '' </EX-S>
</EXAMPLE>
<P>
<S ID='S-43' AZ='CTR'> One might wonder whether the subject is She or Mr. Vale . </S>
<S ID='S-44' AZ='OWN'> In some cases , the algorithm might need to be further specificied in order to be able to process any of the data , whereas in others they may just highlight where the algorithm needs to be modified ( see section <CREF/> ) . </S>
<S ID='S-45' AZ='OWN'> In general we count underspecifications as failures . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-46' AZ='OWN'> Finally , it may not be clear what the DEFINITION OF SUCCESS is . </S>
<S ID='S-47' AZ='OWN'> In particular it is not clear what to do in those cases where an algorithm produces multiple or partial interpretations . </S>
<S ID='S-48' AZ='OWN'> In this situation a system might flag the utterance as ambiguous and draw in support from other discourse components . </S>
<S ID='S-49' AZ='OWN' TYPE='ITEM'> This arises in the present analysis for two reasons : </S>
<S ID='S-50' TYPE='ITEM' AZ='OWN'> the constraints given by <REF TYPE='A'>Grosz et al. 1986</REF> do not always allow one to choose a preferred interpretation , </S>
<S ID='S-51' TYPE='ITEM' AZ='OWN'> the <REFAUTHOR SELF="YES">Brennan et al.</REFAUTHOR> algorithm proposes equally ranked interpretations in parallel . </S>
<S ID='S-52' AZ='CTR'> This doesn't happen with the <REFAUTHOR>Hobbs</REFAUTHOR> algorithm because it proposes interpretations in a sequential manner , one at a time . </S>
<S ID='S-53' AZ='OWN'> We chose to count as a failure those situations in which the <REFAUTHOR SELF="YES">Brennan et al.</REFAUTHOR> algorithm only reduces the number of possible interpretations , but <REFAUTHOR>Hobbs</REFAUTHOR> algorithm stops with a correct interpretation . </S>
<S ID='S-54' AZ='OWN'> This ignores the fact that <REFAUTHOR>Hobbs</REFAUTHOR> may have rejected a number of interpretations before stopping . </S>
<S ID='S-55' AZ='OWN'> We also have not needed to make a decision on how to score an algorithm that only finds one interpretation for an utterance that humans find ambiguous . </S>
</P>
<DIV DEPTH='3'>
<HEADER ID='H-3'> Centering Algorithm </HEADER>
<P>
<S ID='S-56' AZ='OTH'> The centering algorithm as defined by <REFAUTHOR SELF="YES">Brennan et al.</REFAUTHOR> ( BNF algorithm ) , is derived from a set of rules and constraints put forth by <REFAUTHOR>Grosz et al.</REFAUTHOR> <REF TYPE='P'>Grosz et al. 1983</REF> , <REF TYPE='P'>Grosz et al. 1986</REF> . </S>
<S ID='S-57' AZ='OTH'> We shall not reproduce this algorithm here <REF TYPE='P' SELF="YES">Brennan et al. 1987</REF> . </S>
<S ID='S-58' AZ='OTH'> There are two main structures in the centering algorithm , the CB , the BACKWARD LOOKING CENTER , which is what the discourse is ` about ' , and an ordered list , CF , of FORWARD LOOKING CENTERS , which are the discourse entities available to the next utterance for pronominalization . </S>
<S ID='S-59' AZ='OTH'> The centering framework predicts that in a local coherent stretch of dialogue , speakers will prefer to CONTINUE talking about the same discourse entity , that the CB will be the highest ranked entity of the previous utterance 's forward centers that is realized in the current utterance , and that if anything is pronominalized the CB must be . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-60' AZ='OTH'> In the centering framework , the order of the forward-centers list is intended to reflect the salience of discourse entities . </S>
<S ID='S-61' AZ='OTH'> The <REFAUTHOR SELF="YES">Brennan et al.</REFAUTHOR> algorithm orders this list by grammatical relation of the complements of the main verb , i.e. first the subject , then object , then indirect object , then other subcategorized-for complements , then noun phrases found in adjunct clauses . </S>
<S ID='S-62' AZ='OTH'> This captures the intuition that subjects are more salient than other discourse entities . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-63' AZ='OTH'> The <REFAUTHOR SELF="YES">Brennan et al.</REFAUTHOR> algorithm added linguistic constraints on CONTRA-INDEXING to the centering framework . </S>
<S ID='S-64' AZ='OTH'> These constraints are exemplified by the fact that , in the sentence he likes him , the entity cospecified by he cannot be the same as that cospecified by him . </S>
<S ID='S-65' AZ='OTH'> We say that he and him are CONTRA-INDEXED . </S>
<S ID='S-66' AZ='OTH'> The <REFAUTHOR SELF="YES">Brennan et al.</REFAUTHOR> algorithm depends on semantic processing to precompute these constraints , since they are derived from the syntactic structure , and depend on some notion of c-command <REF TYPE='P'>Reinhart 1976</REF> . </S>
<S ID='S-67' AZ='OTH'> The other assumption that is dependent on syntax is that the the representations of discourse entities can be marked with the grammatical function through which they were realized , e.g. subject . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-68' AZ='OTH'> The <REFAUTHOR SELF="YES">Brennan et al.</REFAUTHOR> algorithm assumes that some other mechanism can structure both written texts and task-oriented dialogues into hierarchical segments . </S>
<S ID='S-69' AZ='OTH'> The present concern is not with whether there might be a grammar of discourse that determines this structure , or whether it is derived from the cues that cooperative speakers give hearers to aid in processing . </S>
<S ID='S-70' AZ='OTH'> Since centering is a local phenomenon and is intended to operate within a segment , we needed to deduce a segmental structure in order to analyse the data . </S>
<S ID='S-71' AZ='OTH'> Speaker 's intentions , task structure , cue words like `` O.K. now ... '' , intonational properties of utterances , coherence relations , the scoping of modal operators , and mechanisms for shifting control between discourse participants have all been proposed as ways of determining discourse segmentation <REF TYPE='P'>Grosz 1977</REF> , <REF TYPE='P'>Grosz and Sidner 1986</REF> , <REF TYPE='P'>Reichman 1985</REF> , <REF TYPE='P'>Pierrehumbert and Hirschberg 1990</REF> , <REF TYPE='P'>Hirschberg and Litman 1987</REF> , <REF TYPE='P'>Hobbs 1978</REF> , <REF TYPE='P'>Hobbs 1985</REF> , <REF  TYPE='P'>Roberts 1988</REF>, <REF  TYPE='P'>Whittaker and Stenton 1988</REF> . </S>
<S ID='S-72' AZ='OTH'> Here , we use a combination of orthography , anaphora distribution , cue words and task structure . </S>
<S ID='S-73' AZ='OTH'> The rules are : </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-74' AZ='OTH'> In published texts , a paragraph is a new segment unless the first sentence has a pronoun in subject position or a pronoun where none of the preceding sentence-internal noun phrases match its syntactic features . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-75' AZ='OTH'> In the task-oriented dialogues , the action PICK-UP marks task boundaries hence segment boundaries . </S>
<S ID='S-76' AZ='OTH'> Cue words like next , then , and now also mark segment boundaries . </S>
<S ID='S-77' AZ='OTH'> These will usually co-occur but either one is sufficient for marking a segment boundary . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-78' AZ='OTH'> <REFAUTHOR SELF="YES">Brennan et al.</REFAUTHOR> never state that cospecifiers for pronouns within the same segment are preferred over those in previous segments , but this is an implicit assumption , since this line of research is derived from <REFAUTHOR>Sidner</REFAUTHOR> 's work on local focusing . </S>
<S ID='S-79' AZ='OTH'> Segment initial utterances therefore are the only situation where the <REFAUTHOR SELF="YES">Brennan et al.</REFAUTHOR> algorithm will prefer a within-sentence noun phrase as the cospecifier of a pronoun . </S>
</P>

<DIV DEPTH='3'>
<HEADER ID='H-4'> <REFAUTHOR>Hobbs</REFAUTHOR> 's algorithm </HEADER><P>
<S ID='S-80' AZ='OTH'> The <REFAUTHOR>Hobbs</REFAUTHOR> algorithm is based on searching for a pronoun 's co-specifier in the syntactic parse tree of input sentences <REF TYPE='P'>Hobbs 1976b</REF> . </S>
<S ID='S-81' AZ='TXT'> We reproduce this algorithm in full in the appendix along with an example . </S>
<S ID='S-82' AZ='OTH'> <REFAUTHOR>Hobbs</REFAUTHOR> algorithm operates on one sentence at a time , but the structure of previous sentences in the discourse is available . </S>
<S ID='S-83' AZ='OTH'> It is stated in terms of searches on parse trees . </S>
<S ID='S-84' AZ='OTH'> When looking for an intrasentential antecedent , these searches are conducted in a left-to-right , breadth-first manner . </S>
<S ID='S-85' AZ='OTH'> However , when looking for a pronoun 's antecedent within a sentence , it will go sequentially further and further up the tree to the left of the pronoun , and that failing will look in the previous sentence . </S>
<S ID='S-86' AZ='OTH'> <REFAUTHOR>Hobbs</REFAUTHOR> does not assume a segmentation of discourse structure in this algorithm ; the algorithm will go back arbitrarily far in the text to find an antecedent . </S>
<S ID='S-87' AZ='OTH'> In more recent work , <REFAUTHOR>Hobbs</REFAUTHOR> uses the notion of COHERENCE RELATIONS to structure the discourse <REF TYPE='P'>Hobbs and Martin 1987</REF> . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-88' AZ='OTH'> The order by which <REFAUTHOR>Hobbs</REFAUTHOR> 's algorithm traverses the parse tree is the closest thing in his framework to predictions about which discourse entities are salient . </S>
<S ID='S-89' AZ='OTH'> In the main it prefers co-specifiers for pronouns that are within the same sentence , and also ones that are closer to the pronoun in the sentence . </S>
<S ID='S-90' AZ='OTH'> This amounts to a claim that different discourse entities are salient , depending on the position of a pronoun in a sentence . </S>
<S ID='S-91' AZ='OTH'> When seeking an intersentential co-specification , <REFAUTHOR>Hobbs</REFAUTHOR> algorithm searches the parse tree of the previous utterance breadth-first , from left to right . </S>
<S ID='S-92' AZ='OTH'> This predicts that entities realized in subject position are more salient , since even if an adjunct clause linearly precedes the main subject , any noun phrases within it will be deeper in the parse tree . </S>
<S ID='S-93' AZ='OTH'> This also means that objects and indirect objects will be among the first possible antecedents found , and in general that the depth of syntactic embedding is an important determiner of discourse prominence . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-94' AZ='OTH'> Turning to the assumptions about syntax , we note that <REFAUTHOR>Hobbs</REFAUTHOR> assumes that one can produce the correct syntactic structure for an utterance , with all adjunct phrases attached at the proper point of the parse tree . </S>
<S ID='S-95' AZ='OTH'> In addition , in order to obey linguistic constraints on coreference , the algorithm depends on the existence of a <EQN/> parse tree node , which denotes a noun phrase without its determiner ( See the example in the Appendix ) . </S>
<S ID='S-96' AZ='OTH'> <REFAUTHOR>Hobbs</REFAUTHOR> algorithm procedurally encodes contra-indexing constraints by skipping over NP nodes whose <EQN/> node dominates the part of the parse tree in which the pronoun is found , which means that he cannot guarantee that two contra-indexed pronouns will not choose the same NP as a co-specifier . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-97' AZ='OTH'> <REFAUTHOR>Hobbs</REFAUTHOR> also assumes that his algorithm can somehow collect discourse entities mentioned alone into sets as co-specifiers of plural anaphors . </S>
<S ID='S-98' AZ='OTH'> <REFAUTHOR>Hobbs</REFAUTHOR> discusses at length other assumptions that he makes about the capabilities of an interpretive process that operates before the algorithm <REF TYPE='P'>Hobbs 1976b</REF> . </S>
<S ID='S-99' AZ='OTH'> This includes such things as being able to recover syntactically recoverable omitted text , such as elided verb phrases , and the identities of the speakers and hearers in a dialogue . </S>
</P>
</DIV>
<DIV DEPTH='3'>
<HEADER ID='H-5'> Summary </HEADER>
<P>
<S ID='S-100' AZ='BKG'> A major component of any discourse algorithm is the prediction of which entities are salient , even though all the factors that contribute to the salience of a discourse entity have not been identified <REF TYPE='P'>Prince 1981</REF> , <REF TYPE='P'>Prince 1985</REF> , <REF  TYPE='P'>Brown and Fish 1983</REF>, <REF  TYPE='P'>Hudson et al. 1986</REF> . </S>
<S ID='S-101' AZ='OWN'> So an obvious question is when the two algorithms actually make different predictions . </S>
<S ID='S-102' AZ='OWN'> The main difference is that the choice of a co-specifier for a pronoun in the <REFAUTHOR>Hobbs</REFAUTHOR> algorithm depends in part on the position of that pronoun in the sentence . </S>
<S ID='S-103' AZ='OTH'> In the centering framework , no matter what criteria one uses to order the forward-centers list , pronouns take the most salient entities as antecedents , irrespective of that pronoun 's position . </S>
<S ID='S-104' AZ='OTH'> <REFAUTHOR>Hobbs</REFAUTHOR> ordering of entities from a previous utterance varies from <REFAUTHOR SELF="YES">Brennan et al.</REFAUTHOR> in that possessors come before case-marked objects and indirect objects , and there may be some other differences as well but none of them were relevant to the analysis that follows . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-105' AZ='OWN'> The effects of some of the assumptions are measurable and we will attempt to specify exactly what these effects are , however some are not , e.g. we cannot measure the effect of <REFAUTHOR>Hobbs</REFAUTHOR> 's syntax assumption since it is difficult to say how likely one is to get the wrong parse . </S>
<S ID='S-106' AZ='OWN'> We adopt the set collection assumption for both algorithms as well as the ability to recover the identity of speakers and hearers in dialogue . </S>

<HEADER ID='H-6'> Quantitative Results of the Algorithms </HEADER>

<S ID='S-107' AZ='OWN'> The texts on which the algorithms are analysed are the first chapter of Arthur Hailey 's novel Wheels , and the July 7 , 1975 edition of Newsweek . </S>
<S ID='S-108' AZ='OWN'> The sentences in Wheels are short and simple with long sequences consisting of reported conversation , so it is similar to a conversational text . </S>

<S ID='S-211' TYPE='ITEM' AZ='OWN'> we discover ways we can improve current theories . </S>
<S ID='S-212' AZ='OWN'> A split of evaluation efforts into quantitative versus qualitative is incoherent . </S>
<S ID='S-213' AZ='OWN'> We cannot trust the results of a quantitative evaluation without doing a considerable amount of qualitative analyses and we should perform our qualitative analyses on those components that make a significant contribution to the quantitative results ; we need to be able to measure the effect of various factors . </S>
<S ID='S-214' AZ='OWN'> These measurements must be made by doing comparisons at the data level . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-215' AZ='OWN'> In terms of general results , we have identified some factors that make evaluations of this type more complicated and which might lead us to evaluate solely quantitative results with care . </S>
<S ID='S-216' AZ='OWN' TYPE='ITEM'> These are : </S>
<S ID='S-217' TYPE='ITEM' AZ='OWN'> To decide how to evaluate UNDERSPECIFICATIONS and the contribution of ASSUMPTIONS , and </S>
<S ID='S-218' TYPE='ITEM' AZ='OWN'> To determine the effects of FALSE POSITIVES and ERROR CHAINING . </S>
<S ID='S-219' AZ='OWN'> We advocate an approach in which the contribution of each underspecification and assumption is tabulated as well as the effect of error chains . </S>
<S ID='S-220' AZ='OWN'> If a principled way could be found to identify false positives , their effect should be reported as well as part of any quantitative evaluation . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-221' AZ='OWN'> In addition , we have taken a few steps towards determining the relative importance of different factors to the successful operation of discourse modules . </S>
<S ID='S-222' AZ='OWN'> The percent of successes that both algorithms get indicates that syntax has a strong influence , and that at the very least we can reduce the amount of inference required . </S>
<S ID='S-223' AZ='OWN'> In 59 % to 82 % of the cases both algorithms get the correct result . </S>
<S ID='S-224' AZ='OWN'> This probably means that in a large number of cases there was no potential conflict of co-specifiers . </S>
<S ID='S-225' AZ='OWN'> In addition , this analysis has shown , that at least for task-oriented dialogues global focus is a significant factor , and in general discourse structure is more important in the task dialogues . </S>
<S ID='S-226' AZ='OWN'> However simple devices such as cue words may go a long way toward determining this structure . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-227' AZ='OWN'> Finally , we should note that doing evaluations such as this allows us to determine the GENERALITY of our approaches . </S>
<S ID='S-228' AZ='OWN'> Since the performance of both <REFAUTHOR>Hobbs</REFAUTHOR> and <REFAUTHOR SELF="YES">Brennan et al.</REFAUTHOR> varies according to the type of the text , and in fact was significantly worse on the task dialogues than on the texts , we might question how their performance would vary on other inputs . </S>
<S ID='S-229' AZ='OWN'> An annotated corpus comprising some of the various NL input types such as those I discussed in the introduction would go a long way towards giving us a basis against which we could evaluate the generality of our theories . </S>
