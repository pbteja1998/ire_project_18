<HEADER ID='H-0'> Introduction </HEADER>
<P>
<S ID='S-0' AZ='OTH'> The resource-based approach to semantic composition in Lexical-Functional Grammar ( LFG ) obtains the interpretation for a phrase via a logical deduction , beginning with the interpretations of its parts as premises <REF SELF="YES" TYPE='P'>Dalrymple et al. 1993b</REF> . </S>
<S ID='S-1' AZ='OTH'> The resource-sensitive system of linear logic is used to compute meanings in accordance with relationships manifest in LFG f-structures . </S>
<S ID='S-2' AZ='OTH'> The properties of the system ensure that meanings are used exactly once , allowing coherence and completeness conditions on f-structures <REF TYPE='P'>Kaplan and Bresnan 1982</REF> , to be maintained . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-3' AZ='CTR'> However , there are cases where a single constituent appears to yield more than one contribution to the meaning of an utterance . </S>
<S ID='S-4' AZ='CTR'> This is most obvious in , but is not limited to , sentences involving coordination . </S>
<S ID='S-5' AZ='CTR'> In example <CREF/> , for instance , NAFTA is the object of two different verbs : </S>
</P>
<EXAMPLE ID='E-0'>
<EX-S> Bill supported , and Hillary opposed , NAFTA . </EX-S>
</EXAMPLE>
<P>
<S ID='S-6' AZ='CTR'> Since the hallmark of the linear logic approach is to ensure that f-structure contributions are utilized exactly once in a derivation , such constructions would at first glance appear to be problematic for the approach . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-7' ABSTRACTC='A-0' AZ='OWN'> We argue that the resource sharing that is commonly manifest in the treatment of coordination in other approaches is appropriately handled by exploiting the structure-sharing in LFG f-structures . </S>
<S ID='S-8' AZ='BAS'> We refine our previous analysis to account for cases where an f-structure is reached by multiple paths from an enclosing f-structure . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-9' AZ='OTH'> <REF TYPE='A' SELF="YES">Dalrymple et al. 1993b</REF> provides an account of LFG semantics that represents the meaning of lexical items with linear logic formulas . </S>
<S ID='S-10' AZ='OTH'> These formulas manipulate basic assertions of the form <EQN/> , for f-structures f and meaning logic terms M . </S>
<S ID='S-11' AZ='OTH'> Here <EQN/> is a mapping , the semantic projection , that relates f-structures to semantic structures . </S>
<S ID='S-12' AZ='OWN'> To distinguish between multiple paths entering an f-structure , we now take <EQN/> to map from sets of paths in f-structures to semantic structures . </S>
<S ID='S-13' AZ='OWN'> Further , the paths between f-structures are made available in the semantic space as resources . </S>
<S ID='S-14' AZ='OWN'> This makes it possible for the semantic formulas to exploit information about the multiple paths into an f-structure in order to account for the multiple uses of the f-structure 's semantic contribution . </S>
<S ID='S-15' ABSTRACTC='A-2' AZ='OWN'> The resulting system is sufficiently restricted in cases where other approaches overgenerate ; the very property of resource-sensitivity for which resource sharing appears to be problematic actually provides explanatory advantages over systems that more freely replicate resources during derivation . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-16' AZ='TXT'> In Section <CREF/> , we review previous approaches to the semantics of coordination and argument sharing , and make note of some of their drawbacks . </S>
<S ID='S-17' AZ='TXT'> We describe the revised semantic framework in Section <CREF/> , and work through several examples of non-constituent coordination ( specifically , right-node raising ) in Section <CREF/> . </S>
<S ID='S-18' AZ='TXT'> We discuss examples involving intensional verbs in Section <CREF/> . </S>

<HEADER ID='H-2'> Combinatory Categorial Grammar </HEADER>
<P>
<S ID='S-19' AZ='OTH'> <REFAUTHOR>Steedman</REFAUTHOR> <REF TYPE='P'>Steedman 1985</REF> , <REF TYPE='P'>Steedman 1989</REF> , <REF TYPE='P'>Steedman 1990</REF> , working in the framework of Combinatory Categorial Grammar ( CCG ) , presents what is probably the most adequate analysis of non-constituent coordination to date . </S>
<S ID='S-20' AZ='OTH'> As noted by <REFAUTHOR>Steedman</REFAUTHOR> and discussed by <REF TYPE='A'>Oehrle 1990</REF> , the addition of the rule of function composition to the inventory of syntactic rules in Categorial Grammar enables the formation of constituents with right-peripheral gaps , providing a basis for a clean treatment of cases of right node raising as exemplified by sentence <CREF/> . </S>
<S ID='S-21' AZ='OTH'> Such examples are handled by a coordination schema which allows like categories to be conjoined , shown in <CREF/> . </S>
</P>
<EXAMPLE ID='E-1'>
<EX-S> Coordination :  X CONJ X <EQN/> X</EX-S>
</EXAMPLE>
<P>
<S ID='S-22' AZ='OTH'> This schema gives rise to various actual rules whose semantics depends on the number of arguments that the shared material takes . </S>
<S ID='S-23' AZ='OTH'> For the cases of RNR considered here , the rule has the form shown in <CREF/> . </S>
</P>
<EXAMPLE ID='E-2'>
<EX-S> ( coordination ) X / Y : <EQN/> </EX-S>
</EXAMPLE>
<P>
<S ID='S-24' AZ='OTH'> The contraction from <EQN/> and <EQN/> to <EQN/> in this rule allows for the single argument to be utilized twice . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-25' AZ='CTR'> As noted by <REF TYPE='A'>Hudson 1976</REF> , however , not all examples of RNR involve coordinate structures : </S>
</P>
<EXAMPLE ID='E-3'>
<EX-S> Citizens who support , paraded against politicians who oppose , two trade bills . </EX-S>
</EXAMPLE>
<P>
<S ID='S-26' AZ='CTR'> Obviously , such cases fall outside of the purview of the coordination schema . </S>
<S ID='S-27' AZ='OTH'> An analysis for this sentence is available in the CCG framework by the addition of the xsubstitute combinator <REFAUTHOR>Steedman</REFAUTHOR> , as defined in <REF TYPE='A'>Steedman 1987</REF> . </S>
</P>
<IMAGE ID='I-0'/>
<P>
<S ID='S-28' AZ='OTH'> The use of this combinator assimilates cases of noncoordinate RNR to cases involving parasitic gaps . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-29' AZ='CTR'> While this approach has some drawbacks , we do not offer a competing analysis of the syntax of sentences like <CREF/> here . </S>
<S ID='S-30' AZ='AIM'> Rather , we seek an analysis of RNR ( and of resource sharing in general ) that is uniform in the semantics ; such a treatment isn't available in CCG because of its tight integration between syntax and semantics . </S>
</P>

<HEADER ID='H-3'> <REFAUTHOR>Partee and Rooth</REFAUTHOR> </HEADER><P>
<S ID='S-31' AZ='OTH'> Perhaps the most influential and widely-adopted semantic treatment of coordination is the approach of <REF TYPE='A'>Partee and Rooth 1983</REF> . </S>
<S ID='S-32' AZ='OTH'> They propose a generalized conjunction scheme in which conjuncts of the same type can be combined . </S>
<S ID='S-33' AZ='OTH'> As is the case with <REFAUTHOR>Steedman</REFAUTHOR> 's operators , contraction inherent in the schema allows for a single shared argument to be distributed as an argument of each conjunct . </S>
<S ID='S-34' AZ='OTH'> Type-lifting is allowed to produce like types when necessary ; the combination of the coordination scheme and type-lifting can have the effect of ` copying ' an argument of higher type , such as a quantifier in the case of coordinated intensional verbs . </S>
<S ID='S-35' AZ='OTH'> They propose a ` processing strategy ' requiring that expressions are interpreted at the lowest possible type , with type-raising taking place only where necessary . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-36' AZ='OTH'> To illustrate , <REFAUTHOR>Partee and Rooth</REFAUTHOR> assume that extensional verbs such as find are entered in the lexicon with basic type <EQN/> , whereas intensional verbs like want , which require a quantifier as an argument , have type <EQN/> ( ignoring intensionality ) . </S>
<S ID='S-37' AZ='OTH'> Two extensional verbs such as find and support are coordinated at their basic types : </S>
</P>
<EXAMPLE ID='E-4'>
<EX-S> find and support ( type <EQN/> ) : </EX-S>
</EXAMPLE>
<IMAGE ID='I-1'/>
<P>
<S ID='S-38' AZ='OTH'> Two intensional verbs such as want and seek are also coordinated at their basic ( higher ) types : </S>
</P>
<EXAMPLE ID='E-5'>
<EX-S> want and seek ( type <EQN/> ) : </EX-S>
</EXAMPLE>
<IMAGE ID='I-2'/>
<P>
<S ID='S-39' AZ='OTH'> The argument to this expression is a quantified NP . </S>
<S ID='S-40' AZ='OTH'> When an intensional and an extensional verb are coordinated , the extensional verb must be type-raised to promote it to the type of the intensional verb : </S>
</P>
<EXAMPLE ID='E-6'>
<EX-S> want and find ( type <EQN/> ) : </EX-S>
</EXAMPLE>
<IMAGE ID='I-3'/>
<P>
<S ID='S-41' AZ='OTH'> Again , this leads to the desired result . </S>
<S ID='S-42' AZ='CTR'> However , an unwelcome consequence of this approach , which appears to have gone unnoticed in the literature , arises in cases in which more than two verbs are conjoined . </S>
<S ID='S-43' AZ='OTH'> If an intensional verb is coordinated with more than one extensional verb , a copy of the quantifier will be distributed to each verb in the coordinate structure . </S>
<S ID='S-44' AZ='OTH'> For instance , in <CREF/> , two extensional verbs and an intensional verb are coordinated . </S>
</P>
<EXAMPLE ID='E-7'>
<EX-S> want , find , and support : </EX-S>
</EXAMPLE>
<IMAGE ID='I-4'/>
<P>
<S ID='S-45' AZ='OTH'> Application of this expression to a quantifier results in two quantifiers being scoped separately over the extensional verbs . </S>
<S ID='S-46' AZ='CTR'> This is the wrong result ; in a sentence such as ` Hillary wanted , found , and supported two candidates ' , the desired result is where one quantifier scopes over both extensional verbs ( that is , Hillary found and supported the same two candidates ) , just as in the case where all the verbs are extensional . </S>
<S ID='S-47' AZ='CTR'> Further , there does not seem to be an obvious way to modify the <REFAUTHOR>Partee and Rooth</REFAUTHOR> proposal so as to produce the correct result , the problem being that the ability to copy quantifiers inherent in their schema is too unrestricted . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-48' AZ='CTR'> A second problem with the account is that , as with <REFAUTHOR>Steedman</REFAUTHOR> 's coordination schema , <REFAUTHOR>Partee and Rooth</REFAUTHOR> 's type-raising strategy only applies to coordinate structures . </S>
<S ID='S-49' AZ='CTR'> However , the need to type-raise extends to cases not involving coordination , as in sentence <CREF/> . </S>
</P>
<EXAMPLE ID='E-8'>
<EX-S> Citizens who seek , paraded against politicians who have , a decent health insurance policy . </EX-S>
</EXAMPLE>
<P>
<S ID='S-50' AZ='AIM'> We will present an analysis that preserves the intuition underlying <REFAUTHOR>Partee and Rooth</REFAUTHOR> 's processing strategy , but that predicts and generates the correct reading for cases such as <CREF/> . </S>
<S ID='S-51' AZ='OWN'> Furthermore , the account applies equally to examples not involving coordination , as is the case in sentence <CREF/> . </S>

<HEADER ID='H-4'> LFG and Linear Logic </HEADER>

<S ID='S-52' AZ='BKG'> LFG assumes two syntactic levels of representation : constituent structure ( c-structure ) encodes phrasal dominance and precedence relations , and functional structure ( f-structure ) encodes syntactic predicate-argument structure . </S>

<S ID='S-58' AZ='BKG'> The meaning language could be that of any appropriate logic ; for present purposes , higher-order logic will suffice . </S>
<S ID='S-59' AZ='BKG'> Expressions of the meaning language ( such as Bill ) appear on the right side of the meaning relation <EQN/> . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-60' AZ='BKG'> The glue language is the tensor fragment of linear logic <REF TYPE='P'>Girard 1987</REF> . </S>
<S ID='S-61' AZ='BKG'> The semantic contribution of each lexical entry , which we will refer to as a meaning constructor , is a linear-logic formula consisting of instructions in the glue language for combining the meanings of the lexical entry 's syntactic arguments to obtain the meaning of the f-structure headed by the entry . </S>
<S ID='S-62' AZ='BKG'> For instance , the meaning constructor for the verb supported is a glue language formula paraphrasable as : `` If my SUBJ means X and ( <EQN/> ) my OBJ means Y , then ( <EQN/> ) my sentence means <EQN/> '' . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-63' AZ='OTH'> In the system described in <REF TYPE='A' SELF="YES">Dalrymple et al. 1993b</REF> , the <EQN/> relation associates expressions in the meaning language with f-structures . </S>
<S ID='S-64' AZ='OTH'> As a result , each f-structure contributed a single meaning constructor as a resource to be used in a derivation . </S>
<S ID='S-65' AZ='CTR'> Because linear logic does not have any form of logical contraction ( as is inherent in the approaches discussed earlier ) , cases where resources are shared appear to be problematic in this framework . </S>
<S ID='S-66' AZ='CTR'> Intuitively , however , the need for the multiple use of an f-structure meaning results not from the appearance of a particular lexical item ( e.g. , a conjunction ) or a particular syntactic construction ( e.g. , parasitic gap constructions ) , but instead results from multiple paths to it from within the f-structure that contains it , where structure sharing is motivated on syntactic grounds . </S>
<S ID='S-67' AZ='BAS'> We therefore revise the earlier framework to model what we will term occurrences of f-structures as resources explicitly in the logic . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-68' AZ='OWN'> F-structures can mathematically be regarded as ( finite ) functions from a set of attributes to a set of atomic values , semantic forms and ( recursively ) f-structures . </S>
<S ID='S-69' AZ='OWN'> We will identify an occurrence of an f-structure with a path ( from the root ) to that occurrence ; sets of occurrences of an f-structure can therefore be identified with path sets in the f-structure . </S>
<S ID='S-70' AZ='OWN'> We take , then , the domain of the <EQN/> projection to be path sets in the root f-structure . </S>
<S ID='S-71' AZ='OWN'> Only those path sets S are considered which satisfy the property that the extensions of each path in S are identical . </S>
<S ID='S-72' AZ='OWN'> Therefore the f-structure reached by each of these paths is identical . </S>
<S ID='S-73' AZ='OWN'> Hence from a path set S , we can read off an f-structure <EQN/> . </S>
<S ID='S-74' AZ='OTH'> In the examples discussed in <REF TYPE='A' SELF="YES">Dalrymple et al. 1993b</REF> there is a one-to-one correspondence between the set of path sets S and the set of f-structures <EQN/> picked out by such path sets , so the two methods yield the same predictions for those cases . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-75' AZ='OWN'> Relations between path sets are represented explicitly as resources in the logic by R-relations . </S>
<S ID='S-76' AZ='OWN'> R-relations are represented as three-place predicates of the form <EQN/> which indicate that ( the path set ) G appears at the end of a path P ( of length 1 ) extending ( the path set ) F . </S>
<S ID='S-77' AZ='OWN'> That is , the f-structure <EQN/> appears at the end of the singleton path P in the f-structure <EQN/> . </S>
<S ID='S-78' AZ='OWN'> For example , the f-structure given in <CREF/> results in two R-relations : </S>

<S ID='S-80' AZ='OWN'> An axiom for interpretation provides the links between meanings of path sets related by R-relations . </S>

<P>
<S ID='S-81' AZ='OWN'> According to this axiom , if a set of paths G has meaning X , then for each R-relation <EQN/> that has been introduced , a resource <EQN/> can be produced . </S>

<S ID='S-83' AZ='OWN'> We show how a deduction can be performed to derive a meaning for example <CREF/> using the meaning constructors in <CREF/> , R-relations <CREF/> and <CREF/> , and Axiom I. </S>

<S ID='S-93' AZ='OWN'> The use of linear logic provides a flexible mechanism for deducing meanings of sentences based on their f-structure representations . </S>
<S ID='S-94' AZ='BAS'> Accounts of various linguistic phenomena have been developed within the framework on which our extension is based , including quantifiers and anaphora <REF TYPE='P' SELF="YES">Dalrymple et al. 1994a</REF> , intensional verbs <REF TYPE='P' SELF="YES">Dalrymple et al. 1994b</REF> , and complex predicates <REF SELF="YES" TYPE='P'>Dalrymple et al. 1993a</REF> . </S>

<S ID='S-125' AZ='OWN'> As previously noted , this separation is not possible in CCG because of the tight integration between syntax and semantics . </S>
<S ID='S-126' AZ='OWN'> In LFG , the syntax / semantics interface is more loosely coupled , affording the flexibility to handle coordinated and non-coordinated cases of RNR uniformly in the semantics . </S>
<S ID='S-127' AZ='OWN'> This also allows for our semantics of coordination not to require schemas nor entities of polymorphic type ; our meaning of and is type <EQN/> . </S>

<S ID='S-134' AZ='BAS'> Following the analysis given in <REF TYPE='A' SELF="YES">Dalrymple et al. 1994b</REF> , the lexical entry for want takes a quantified NP as an argument . </S>

<S ID='S-142' AZ='BAS'> We can now specify a <REFAUTHOR>Partee and Rooth</REFAUTHOR> style processing strategy , which is to prefer readings which require the least use of QNP duplication . </S>

<S ID='S-145' AZ='CTR'> While the reading generated by <REFAUTHOR>Partee and Rooth</REFAUTHOR> is derivable , it requires three quantifiers and thus uses QNP duplication twice , which is less preferred than the reading requiring two quantifiers which uses QNP duplication once . </S>
<S ID='S-146' AZ='CTR'> Also , it allows some flexibility in cases where pragmatics strongly suggests that quantifiers are copied and distributed for multiple extensional verbs ; unlike the <REFAUTHOR>Partee and Rooth</REFAUTHOR> account , this would apply equally to the case where there are also intensional verbs and the case where there are not . </S>
<S ID='S-147' AZ='OWN'> Finally , our account readily applies to cases of intensional verbs without coordination as in example <CREF/> , since it applies more generally to cases of resource sharing . </S>

<HEADER ID='H-9'> Conclusions and Future Work </HEADER>
<P>
<S ID='S-148' AZ='AIM'> We have given an account of resource sharing in the syntax / semantics interface of LFG . </S>
<S ID='S-149' ABSTRACTC='A-1' AZ='OWN'> The multiple use of semantic contributions results from viewing dependencies in f-structures as resources ; in this way the one-to-one correspondence between f-structure relations and meanings is maintained . </S>
<S ID='S-150' AZ='CTR'> The resulting account does not suffer from overgeneration inherent in other approaches , and applies equally to cases of resource sharing that do not involve coordination . </S>
<S ID='S-151' AZ='CTR'> Furthermore , it lends itself readily to an extension for the intensional verb case that has advantages over the widely-assumed account of <REF TYPE='A'>Partee and Rooth 1983</REF> . </S>
</P>
<P>
<S ID='S-152' AZ='OWN'> Here we have separated the issue of arriving at the appropriate f-structure in the syntax from the issue of deriving the correct semantics from the f-structure . </S>
<S ID='S-153' AZ='OWN'> We have argued that this is the correct distinction to make , and have given a treatment of the second issue . </S>
<S ID='S-154' AZ='OWN'> A treatment of the first issue will be articulated in a future forum . </S>
