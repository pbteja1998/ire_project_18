A meta-analysis of the prevalence of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in incarcerated populations.

Abstract

Studies report the variable prevalence of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
(ADHD) in incarcerated populations. The aim of this meta-analysis was to determine the
prevalence of ADHD in these populations.

Primary research studies reporting the prevalence (lifetime/current) of ADHD in
incarcerated populations were identified. The meta-analysis used a mixed log-binomial
model, including fixed effects for each covariate and a random study effect, to estimate
the significance of various risk factors.

Forty-two studies were included in the analysis. ADHD prevalence was higher with
screening diagnoses versus diagnostic interview (and with retrospective
youth diagnoses versus current diagnoses). Using diagnostic interview
data, the estimated prevalence was 25.5% and there were no significant differences for
gender and age. Significant country differences were noted.

Compared with published general population prevalence, there is a fivefold increase in
prevalence of ADHD in youth prison populations (30.1%) and a 10-fold increase in adult
prison populations (26.2%).

Introduction

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is defined in DSM-IV (APA, 1994) and ICD-10 (WHO, 1992) as high levels of hyperactive, impulsive and/or inattentive behaviours
beginning in early childhood. A level of impairment in at least two areas of life needs to
be evident for at least 6 months' duration for a diagnosis of ADHD to be made. ADHD is a
common disorder that often persists into adulthood (Faraone et al.
2006), affecting 3–7% of youths (Asherson, 2004; Asherson et al.
2005; Polanczyk et al.
2007; Willcutt, 2012) and 1–5% of adults (Asherson, 2004;
Asherson et al.
2005, 2012;
Kessler et al.
2006; Simon et al.
2009; Willcutt, 2012).

There is no generally accepted estimate of the prevalence of ADHD in incarcerated
populations; research studies have consistently reported a disproportionately higher rate of
individuals with ADHD in the criminal justice system compared with general population
prevalence. These individuals, who are often untreated, seem to have greater judicial
contact and pose higher risk within the criminal justice system. Compared with other
offenders, they present with younger age at first contact, greater recidivism and
institutional behaviour disturbance (Young et al.
2003, 2009b, 2011). A Scottish prison study found that inmates with
ADHD symptoms were involved in up to eight times more institutional aggression; this strong
association was maintained even when controlling for antisocial personality characteristics,
with aggressive incidents being six times greater compared with non-ADHD peers (Young
et al.
2009b). These problems are likely
to be associated with underlying deficits in executive dysfunction (Young et al.
2007; Bramham et al.
2009; Rose et al.
2009); in particular, behavioural disinhibition and
emotional dysregulation (Gudjonsson et al.
2009, 2012).

However, prevalence varies widely among studies and methodologies differ. Hence, this study
reviewed the data obtained from a systematic literature search performed to ascertain the
lifetime/current prevalence of ADHD in prison populations in both youths and adults. The
study aimed to specify (1) the prevalence of ADHD in incarcerated youth and adult offenders,
including differences by gender; (2) prevalence from studies applying screening tools and
diagnostic clinical interviews; (3) differences in prevalence obtained from retrospective
diagnoses from adults and youth prevalence obtained using a current diagnoses methodology;
and (4) geographical differences.

Method

Studies report the variable prevalence of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
(ADHD) in incarcerated populations. The aim of this meta-analysis was to determine the
prevalence of ADHD in these populations.

Primary research studies reporting the prevalence (lifetime/current) of ADHD in
incarcerated populations were identified. The meta-analysis used a mixed log-binomial
model, including fixed effects for each covariate and a random study effect, to estimate
the significance of various risk factors.

Forty-two studies were included in the analysis. ADHD prevalence was higher with
screening diagnoses versus diagnostic interview (and with retrospective
youth diagnoses versus current diagnoses). Using diagnostic interview
data, the estimated prevalence was 25.5% and there were no significant differences for
gender and age. Significant country differences were noted.

Compared with published general population prevalence, there is a fivefold increase in
prevalence of ADHD in youth prison populations (30.1%) and a 10-fold increase in adult
prison populations (26.2%).

and (4) geographical differences.
Eligibility criteria

The systematic review was performed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA; Liberati et al.
2009) guidelines. Initial searches were carried
out in a variety of databases and websites to gain an understanding of the amount of
information available. Reports published since 1980 and in English were included.
Data sources

Searches were conducted in OvidSP Medline (1948 to present) and EMBASE (1988 to present
segment), Datastar PsycINFO (unrestricted) and Social SciSearch (1972 to date; limited to
English and added since 1 January 1980), including the literature published between 1
January 1980 and 3 May 2011; a citations update was performed on 21 June 2011 and extended
to 31 August 2012 in October 2012.
Search

Search terms were developed, refined and tested for relevance by cross-checking results
against a list of known relevant articles provided by the lead author. The following
descriptors were used in OvidSP EMBASE (1988 to present segment): ADHD; attention deficit
disorder; [EMTREE] crime; criminals; criminology; criminal behaviour; criminal justice;
criminal law; court; criminal psychology; delinquency; juvenile delinquency; gang; legal
evidence; legal procedure; police; legal liability; mandatory programs; violence; prisons;
prisoner; probation; law enforcement; recidivism; jurisprudence; punishment; offender;
drug abuse; drug misuse.
Study selection

Articles obtained from the final searches were first de-duplicated, then an
inclusion/exclusion process was undertaken based on the following exclusion criteria:
non-English language articles, articles published before 1980, animal studies, articles
that were not peer reviewed (e.g. theses), and articles that obviously did not hold
relevance (e.g. they did not focus on ADHD or crime, or they focused on substance misuse
but not from the criminology perspective). Review articles pre-2006 were excluded, and
post-2006 reviews were kept with the sole purpose to examine bibliographies to check for
any other articles not identified in the search; these review articles were not included
in the final prevalence calculation; only primary research articles were included.
Articles with no abstract (including initial PsycINFO and Social SciSearch search outputs)
were also excluded unless the title or other information (e.g. key terms) suggested they
may hold relevance. The inclusion/exclusion review was first completed based on
title/abstract/key words by four researchers, and if the relevance of an article was
unclear, the full text was retrieved before a final decision was made. Once the initial
bulk of the inclusion/exclusion process was completed, abstracts were reviewed
independently by the lead author before full-text articles were retrieved. Any
uncertainties over including/excluding articles were discussed among the researchers and a
final decision was made once the full-text articles were reviewed.

The full texts of included articles were retrieved for detailed evaluation against
eligibility criteria. Only the publications that focused on incarcerated/prison
populations and those that reported ADHD prevalence were selected. Studies that reported
results on mixed gender populations were excluded as we aimed to separate the gender
effect in modelling.
Data collection process

A data extraction sheet was developed in Microsoft Excel and pilot tested on 13 randomly
selected studies and refined accordingly. The publications were divided among four
researchers (including two authors: D.M. and O.S.) who performed the data extraction
independently. Data were reviewed for consistency and any queries were resolved by
discussion among the researchers and the lead author. The lead author also made the final
decision whether to include/exclude data by reviewing the identified publications.

The authors of 11 studies were contacted directly in personal communications to ascertain
missing information relating to age of the study population (Black et al.
2004; Sanz-Garcia et al.
2010a, 
b
), gender (Vitelli, 1996), method of
assessment of ADHD (Gordon & Moore, 2005), study population (Cahill et al.
2012; Colins et al.
2012) and verification of the incarcerated status
of the sample (Langevin, 2003; Rosler et
al.
2009; Retz & Rosler, 2010; Lindsay et al.
2012). All responded with additional information
that had not been included in the original publication and, if meeting inclusion criteria,
was included in this meta-analysis (indicated in Supplementary Tables S1 and S2).

Some cohorts of prison populations were published more than once. To avoid double
counting data, multiple reports of the same cohort were pieced together by juxtaposing
author names, treatment comparisons, sample sizes and outcomes. An exception to this rule
occurred in relation to the Young et al. (2010a, 2011) reports; whereas Young et al. (2010a) used diagnostic interviews, Young et
al. (2011) used screening data to
provide ADHD prevalence. In the interest of obtaining meaningful data on diagnostic
differences in ADHD, these reports were considered as separate studies. In addition,
following author communication, more recent data from Cahill et al.
(2012) were included rather than data from an
earlier publication of the same population (Coolidge et al.
2009).
Data items

For each included study, data were extracted into a data set containing: (1) study
location (country of origin), (2) study sample size, (3) study population (including age
and gender), (4) diagnostic criteria (screening or diagnostic interview), (5) study design
(retrospective, that is adult studies reporting a prevalence of childhood ADHD, or current
diagnoses), (6) ADHD prevalence and (7) treatment (including prison management). We have
used the term ‘prison’ but included all individuals who were incarcerated, jailed or
imprisoned, or similar descriptors. For the analysis, studies were grouped by age for
youth and adult offenders (see Supplementary Tables S1 and S2). It was noted that there
was no clear definition across publications on the age of an adult versus
a youth. For the purposes of this meta-analysis, we designated 18 years to be the cut-off
point for a youth becoming an adult (i.e. youths were ⩽18 years and adults were >18
years); papers reporting youth data often cited 18 years as the upper limit of the age
range of participants. In those papers where an age range was given that spanned this
cut-off point (e.g. 15–28 years), the mean (or median if mean was not provided) was used
to define whether the study population should be listed as ‘youth’ or ‘adult’. For studies
reporting on (1) both genders separately, (2) both diagnostic criteria or (3) both study
designs, information was recorded as two separate observations (‘study strata’) linked by
the study number. None of the studies reported separate results on more than one of these
three characteristics and none reported on both age groups.

For a diagnosis of ADHD to be given in adulthood, clinically significant symptoms must
have been present in childhood. Therefore, when assessing adults for ADHD, it is necessary
to establish whether they meet criteria for childhood ADHD, requiring them to
retrospectively report on their symptoms (if a diagnosis did not already exist). Some
adult studies (n = 13) included in this meta-analysis also reported a
prevalence of childhood ADHD for the cohort (referred to as a retrospective diagnosis in
this study).
Quality control

To ascertain the validity of eligible publications, each researcher checked and
independently reviewed a random sample of each others' papers for data extraction and
interpretation consistency. Disagreements were resolved by reviewing the data source and
by discussion between the three reviewers (one of whom is an author).
Statistical methods

Summary prevalence estimates were calculated for the meta-analysis. Observed prevalence
per study stratum was reported by age and gender groups. Model-predicted prevalence was
reported by the various model covariates together with their corresponding 95% confidence
intervals (CIs).

A mixed log-binomial model was fitted for the observed prevalence in the study strata to
estimate the significance of the various risk factors (model 1). Covariates collected for
predicting ADHD prevalence included gender, age group, diagnostic method, study design and
country. The model included fixed effects for each of the covariates and a random study
effect, and can be defined as follows: 

 where yij is the number of patients with the response, pij is the ADHD prevalence and nij is the total number of inmates included in study i and on stratum
j. As implemented here, the model made the following assumptions: 

Given the observed level of interaction between gender, age group and diagnostic
method, these three covariates were fully interacted in the model and were represented by
eight indicator variables (one omitted as a reference group). Other interactions were also
tested for significance. Marginal estimates of prevalence (least-square means) for each of
the covariates (e.g. males, adults, etc.) and for their combinations were calculated by
applying the inverse logarithmic transformation to model predictors. To estimate the
sensitivity of results to the diagnostic method, the model was refitted to a subset of
data using diagnostic interview strata only (model 2). For the sensitivity analysis model
(model 2), the aforementioned eight indicator variables for the interaction of gender, age
group and diagnostic method were collapsed to four to capture the interaction of
age-by-gender group.

The models were fitted adopting a frequentist estimation approach using PROC GLIMMIX in
SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute, USA).

In total, 8520 publications were identified following the OvidSP Medline, EMBASE, Datastar,
PsycINFO and Social SciSearch database search. Publications not specifically relating to
ADHD and criminality and duplicates between databases were excluded electronically, leaving
325. Once further duplicates had been identified manually, 311 publications remained. A
further 218 publications were excluded after further review as they did not report on
samples composed entirely of incarcerated/prison populations. Of the 93 articles remaining,
a further 40 articles were excluded as they did not provide prevalence data on ADHD; 53
publications included ADHD prevalence data. Three studies (Young et al.
2009a; Ginsberg &
Lindefors, 2012; Tidefors & Strand, 2012) were excluded as they used samples composed
solely of participants who had ADHD, hence giving a prevalence rate of 100%. A further eight
studies were excluded as they only provided mixed-gender prevalence (Milin et al.
1991; Fulwiler et al.
1997; Rasmussen et al.
2000, 2001; Black et al.
2004, 2010;
Anckarsater et al.
2007; Einat & Einat, 2008; Gudjonsson et al.
2009), leaving 42 studies included in the
meta-analysis, reporting prevalence by gender (Fig.
1).

Prevalence

Observed ADHD prevalence per study stratum by age group (youths ⩽18 years and adults
>18 years) and gender showing all data (42 studies, 61 strata) and interview
diagnosis strata (21 studies, 30 strata) are presented in Fig. 2. Bubble plots show the ADHD prevalence per study stratum for the full
sample and the subset of study strata where a diagnostic interview was administered. The
plots demonstrate that some of the high prevalence outliers are study strata where
screening was used for ADHD diagnosis. Thus, all other data used diagnostic data only. No
other differences were observed between the gender and age groups. Table 1 and Figs 3 and ​and44 (and Supplementary Figs S1 and S2) summarize the
results obtained from model 1 (all data, that is both screening and diagnostic interview)
and model 2 (diagnostic interview subset only). There were no significant differences
between genders in both models.

Overall, the observed ADHD prevalence in prison populations in all 42 studies (61 study
strata) was 21.3% (total number of inmates was 26641, of whom 5677 were reported to be
diagnosed with ADHD). The observed ADHD prevalence in prison populations for inmates with
an interview diagnosis (21 studies, 30 study strata) was 20.5% (total number of inmates
was 19575, of whom 4008 were reported to be diagnosed with ADHD).



Studies using screening for diagnosis had a significantly higher estimated ADHD
prevalence of 43.3% (95% CI 33.2–56.4) compared with 25.5% (95% CI 20.0–32.4) obtained
from the subset of studies using a diagnostic clinical interview
(p = 0.001). This suggested a high rate of false positives was being
identified by screening tools, and thus subsequent reported analysis used prevalence
obtained only from diagnostic clinical interview data (i.e. model 2).



ADHD prevalence was estimated to be significantly lower
(p < 0.001) in studies with current diagnoses; ADHD prevalence
for current diagnoses was 21.7% (95% CI 17.5–26.9), compared with 36.4% (95% CI
25.6–51.8) for retrospective diagnoses.



There were significant differences in ADHD prevalence estimated across countries
(p < 0.0001). ADHD prevalence ranged from 6.6% in Brazil
(Ponde et al.
2011) to 65.2% in Sweden (Table 1 and Fig.
2; model 2 diagnostic interview). When aggregated into three regions (North
America, Europe and Other countries), differences were not significant when fitting
models similar to model 2, replacing countries with regions
(p = 0.240); Europe had the highest estimated prevalence (32.1%),
followed by North America (26.9%) and Other countries (17.6%).



Prevalence estimates for males with ADHD were not significantly different from
estimates for females with ADHD: 30.3% (95% CI 23.9–38.4) versus 26.1%
(95% CI 19.3–35.2).



Youth prevalence estimates were not significantly different from estimates for adults:
30.1% (95% CI 22.1–41.1) versus 26.2% (95% CI 18.4–37.5).



Gender-by-age (Table 1 and Fig. 4) comparisons reported that female adults had
the lowest predicted ADHD prevalence: 22.1% (95% CI 13.6–35.8). By contrast, the
prevalence estimate for male adults was 31.2% (95% CI 22.7–42.9). Female and male youth
estimates were 30.8% (95% CI 22.4–42.2) and 29.5% (95% CI 21.6–40.1), respectively.

There were no significant differences found within the clinical interview diagnostic
groups among the four gender-by-age groups.



Studies using screening for diagnosis had a significantly higher estimated ADHD
prevalence of 43.3% (95% CI 33.2–56.4) compared with 25.5% (95% CI 20.0–32.4) obtained

Prevalence estimates for males with ADHD were not significantly different from
estimates for females with ADHD: 30.3% (95% CI 23.9–38.4) versus 26.1%
(95% CI 19.3–35.2).



Youth prevalence estimates were not significantly different from estimates for adults:
30.1% (95% CI 22.1–41.1) versus 26.2% (95% CI 18.4–37.5).



Gender-by-age (Table 1 and Fig. 4) comparisons reported that female adults had
the lowest predicted ADHD prevalence: 22.1% (95% CI 13.6–35.8). By contrast, the
prevalence estimate for male adults was 31.2% (95% CI 22.7–42.9). Female and male youth
estimates were 30.8% (95% CI 22.4–42.2) and 29.5% (95% CI 21.6–40.1), respectively.

There were no significant differences found within the clinical interview diagnostic
groups among the four gender-by-age groups.

Discussion

Studies report the variable prevalence of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
(ADHD) in incarcerated populations. The aim of this meta-analysis was to determine the
prevalence of ADHD in these populations.

Primary research studies reporting the prevalence (lifetime/current) of ADHD in
incarcerated populations were identified. The meta-analysis used a mixed log-binomial
model, including fixed effects for each covariate and a random study effect, to estimate
the significance of various risk factors.

Forty-two studies were included in the analysis. ADHD prevalence was higher with
screening diagnoses versus diagnostic interview (and with retrospective
youth diagnoses versus current diagnoses). Using diagnostic interview
data, the estimated prevalence was 25.5% and there were no significant differences for
gender and age. Significant country differences were noted.

Compared with published general population prevalence, there is a fivefold increase in
prevalence of ADHD in youth prison populations (30.1%) and a 10-fold increase in adult
prison populations (26.2%).

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is defined in DSM-IV (APA, 1994) and ICD-10 (WHO, 1992) as high levels of hyperactive, impulsive and/or inattentive behaviours
beginning in early childhood. A level of impairment in at least two areas of life needs to
be evident for at least 6 months' duration for a diagnosis of ADHD to be made. ADHD is a
common disorder that often persists into adulthood (Faraone et al.
2006), affecting 3–7% of youths (Asherson, 2004; Asherson et al.
2005; Polanczyk et al.
2007; Willcutt, 2012) and 1–5% of adults (Asherson, 2004;
Asherson et al.
2005, 2012;
Kessler et al.
2006; Simon et al.
2009; Willcutt, 2012).

There is no generally accepted estimate of the prevalence of ADHD in incarcerated
populations; research studies have consistently reported a disproportionately higher rate of
individuals with ADHD in the criminal justice system compared with general population
prevalence. These individuals, who are often untreated, seem to have greater judicial
contact and pose higher risk within the criminal justice system. Compared with other
offenders, they present with younger age at first contact, greater recidivism and
institutional behaviour disturbance (Young et al.
2003, 2009b, 2011). A Scottish prison study found that inmates with
ADHD symptoms were involved in up to eight times more institutional aggression; this strong
association was maintained even when controlling for antisocial personality characteristics,
with aggressive incidents being six times greater compared with non-ADHD peers (Young
et al.
2009b). These problems are likely
to be associated with underlying deficits in executive dysfunction (Young et al.
2007; Bramham et al.
2009; Rose et al.
2009); in particular, behavioural disinhibition and
emotional dysregulation (Gudjonsson et al.
2009, 2012).

However, prevalence varies widely among studies and methodologies differ. Hence, this study
reviewed the data obtained from a systematic literature search performed to ascertain the
lifetime/current prevalence of ADHD in prison populations in both youths and adults. The
study aimed to specify (1) the prevalence of ADHD in incarcerated youth and adult offenders,
including differences by gender; (2) prevalence from studies applying screening tools and
diagnostic clinical interviews; (3) differences in prevalence obtained from retrospective
diagnoses from adults and youth prevalence obtained using a current diagnoses methodology;
and (4) geographical differences.

The systematic review was performed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA; Liberati et al.
2009) guidelines. Initial searches were carried
out in a variety of databases and websites to gain an understanding of the amount of
information available. Reports published since 1980 and in English were included.

Searches were conducted in OvidSP Medline (1948 to present) and EMBASE (1988 to present
segment), Datastar PsycINFO (unrestricted) and Social SciSearch (1972 to date; limited to
English and added since 1 January 1980), including the literature published between 1
January 1980 and 3 May 2011; a citations update was performed on 21 June 2011 and extended
to 31 August 2012 in October 2012.

Search terms were developed, refined and tested for relevance by cross-checking results
against a list of known relevant articles provided by the lead author. The following
descriptors were used in OvidSP EMBASE (1988 to present segment): ADHD; attention deficit
disorder; [EMTREE] crime; criminals; criminology; criminal behaviour; criminal justice;
criminal law; court; criminal psychology; delinquency; juvenile delinquency; gang; legal
evidence; legal procedure; police; legal liability; mandatory programs; violence; prisons;
prisoner; probation; law enforcement; recidivism; jurisprudence; punishment; offender;
drug abuse; drug misuse.

Articles obtained from the final searches were first de-duplicated, then an
inclusion/exclusion process was undertaken based on the following exclusion criteria:
non-English language articles, articles published before 1980, animal studies, articles
that were not peer reviewed (e.g. theses), and articles that obviously did not hold
relevance (e.g. they did not focus on ADHD or crime, or they focused on substance misuse
but not from the criminology perspective). Review articles pre-2006 were excluded, and
post-2006 reviews were kept with the sole purpose to examine bibliographies to check for
any other articles not identified in the search; these review articles were not included
in the final prevalence calculation; only primary research articles were included.
Articles with no abstract (including initial PsycINFO and Social SciSearch search outputs)
were also excluded unless the title or other information (e.g. key terms) suggested they
may hold relevance. The inclusion/exclusion review was first completed based on
title/abstract/key words by four researchers, and if the relevance of an article was
unclear, the full text was retrieved before a final decision was made. Once the initial
bulk of the inclusion/exclusion process was completed, abstracts were reviewed
independently by the lead author before full-text articles were retrieved. Any
uncertainties over including/excluding articles were discussed among the researchers and a
final decision was made once the full-text articles were reviewed.

The full texts of included articles were retrieved for detailed evaluation against
eligibility criteria. Only the publications that focused on incarcerated/prison
populations and those that reported ADHD prevalence were selected. Studies that reported
results on mixed gender populations were excluded as we aimed to separate the gender
effect in modelling.

A data extraction sheet was developed in Microsoft Excel and pilot tested on 13 randomly
selected studies and refined accordingly. The publications were divided among four
researchers (including two authors: D.M. and O.S.) who performed the data extraction
independently. Data were reviewed for consistency and any queries were resolved by
discussion among the researchers and the lead author. The lead author also made the final
decision whether to include/exclude data by reviewing the identified publications.

The authors of 11 studies were contacted directly in personal communications to ascertain
missing information relating to age of the study population (Black et al.
2004; Sanz-Garcia et al.
2010a, 
b
), gender (Vitelli, 1996), method of
assessment of ADHD (Gordon & Moore, 2005), study population (Cahill et al.
2012; Colins et al.
2012) and verification of the incarcerated status
of the sample (Langevin, 2003; Rosler et
al.
2009; Retz & Rosler, 2010; Lindsay et al.
2012). All responded with additional information
that had not been included in the original publication and, if meeting inclusion criteria,
was included in this meta-analysis (indicated in Supplementary Tables S1 and S2).

Some cohorts of prison populations were published more than once. To avoid double
counting data, multiple reports of the same cohort were pieced together by juxtaposing
author names, treatment comparisons, sample sizes and outcomes. An exception to this rule
occurred in relation to the Young et al. (2010a, 2011) reports; whereas Young et al. (2010a) used diagnostic interviews, Young et
al. (2011) used screening data to
provide ADHD prevalence. In the interest of obtaining meaningful data on diagnostic
differences in ADHD, these reports were considered as separate studies. In addition,
following author communication, more recent data from Cahill et al.
(2012) were included rather than data from an
earlier publication of the same population (Coolidge et al.
2009).

For each included study, data were extracted into a data set containing: (1) study
location (country of origin), (2) study sample size, (3) study population (including age
and gender), (4) diagnostic criteria (screening or diagnostic interview), (5) study design
(retrospective, that is adult studies reporting a prevalence of childhood ADHD, or current
diagnoses), (6) ADHD prevalence and (7) treatment (including prison management). We have
used the term ‘prison’ but included all individuals who were incarcerated, jailed or
imprisoned, or similar descriptors. For the analysis, studies were grouped by age for
youth and adult offenders (see Supplementary Tables S1 and S2). It was noted that there
was no clear definition across publications on the age of an adult versus
a youth. For the purposes of this meta-analysis, we designated 18 years to be the cut-off
point for a youth becoming an adult (i.e. youths were ⩽18 years and adults were >18
years); papers reporting youth data often cited 18 years as the upper limit of the age
range of participants. In those papers where an age range was given that spanned this
cut-off point (e.g. 15–28 years), the mean (or median if mean was not provided) was used
to define whether the study population should be listed as ‘youth’ or ‘adult’. For studies
reporting on (1) both genders separately, (2) both diagnostic criteria or (3) both study
designs, information was recorded as two separate observations (‘study strata’) linked by
the study number. None of the studies reported separate results on more than one of these
three characteristics and none reported on both age groups.

For a diagnosis of ADHD to be given in adulthood, clinically significant symptoms must
have been present in childhood. Therefore, when assessing adults for ADHD, it is necessary
to establish whether they meet criteria for childhood ADHD, requiring them to
retrospectively report on their symptoms (if a diagnosis did not already exist). Some
adult studies (n = 13) included in this meta-analysis also reported a
prevalence of childhood ADHD for the cohort (referred to as a retrospective diagnosis in
this study).

To ascertain the validity of eligible publications, each researcher checked and
independently reviewed a random sample of each others' papers for data extraction and
interpretation consistency. Disagreements were resolved by reviewing the data source and
by discussion between the three reviewers (one of whom is an author).

Summary prevalence estimates were calculated for the meta-analysis. Observed prevalence
per study stratum was reported by age and gender groups. Model-predicted prevalence was
reported by the various model covariates together with their corresponding 95% confidence
intervals (CIs).

A mixed log-binomial model was fitted for the observed prevalence in the study strata to
estimate the significance of the various risk factors (model 1). Covariates collected for
predicting ADHD prevalence included gender, age group, diagnostic method, study design and
country. The model included fixed effects for each of the covariates and a random study
effect, and can be defined as follows: 

 where yij is the number of patients with the response, pij is the ADHD prevalence and nij is the total number of inmates included in study i and on stratum
j. As implemented here, the model made the following assumptions: 

Given the observed level of interaction between gender, age group and diagnostic
method, these three covariates were fully interacted in the model and were represented by
eight indicator variables (one omitted as a reference group). Other interactions were also
tested for significance. Marginal estimates of prevalence (least-square means) for each of
the covariates (e.g. males, adults, etc.) and for their combinations were calculated by
applying the inverse logarithmic transformation to model predictors. To estimate the
sensitivity of results to the diagnostic method, the model was refitted to a subset of
data using diagnostic interview strata only (model 2). For the sensitivity analysis model
(model 2), the aforementioned eight indicator variables for the interaction of gender, age
group and diagnostic method were collapsed to four to capture the interaction of
age-by-gender group.

The models were fitted adopting a frequentist estimation approach using PROC GLIMMIX in
SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute, USA).

In total, 8520 publications were identified following the OvidSP Medline, EMBASE, Datastar,
PsycINFO and Social SciSearch database search. Publications not specifically relating to
ADHD and criminality and duplicates between databases were excluded electronically, leaving
325. Once further duplicates had been identified manually, 311 publications remained. A
further 218 publications were excluded after further review as they did not report on
samples composed entirely of incarcerated/prison populations. Of the 93 articles remaining,
a further 40 articles were excluded as they did not provide prevalence data on ADHD; 53
publications included ADHD prevalence data. Three studies (Young et al.
2009a; Ginsberg &
Lindefors, 2012; Tidefors & Strand, 2012) were excluded as they used samples composed
solely of participants who had ADHD, hence giving a prevalence rate of 100%. A further eight
studies were excluded as they only provided mixed-gender prevalence (Milin et al.
1991; Fulwiler et al.
1997; Rasmussen et al.
2000, 2001; Black et al.
2004, 2010;
Anckarsater et al.
2007; Einat & Einat, 2008; Gudjonsson et al.
2009), leaving 42 studies included in the
meta-analysis, reporting prevalence by gender (Fig.
1).

plots demonstrate that some of the high prevalence outliers are study strata where
screening was used for ADHD diagnosis. Thus, all other data used diagnostic data only. No
other differences were observed between the gender and age groups. Table 1 and Figs 3 and ​and44 (and Supplementary Figs S1 and S2) summarize the
results obtained from model 1 (all data, that is both screening and diagnostic interview)
and model 2 (diagnostic interview subset only). There were no significant differences
between genders in both models.

Overall, the observed ADHD prevalence in prison populations in all 42 studies (61 study
strata) was 21.3% (total number of inmates was 26641, of whom 5677 were reported to be
diagnosed with ADHD). The observed ADHD prevalence in prison populations for inmates with
an interview diagnosis (21 studies, 30 study strata) was 20.5% (total number of inmates
was 19575, of whom 4008 were reported to be diagnosed with ADHD).
Prevalence

This review presents a meta-analysis of 42 studies conducted in 15 countries that
provides a reliable estimate of 25.5% as the prevalence of ADHD in incarcerated
populations from studies using diagnostic clinical interview. Heterogeneity is likely to
be present in most meta-analyses as individual studies with the ‘same’ population and
study characteristics are never identical with respect to both measured and unmeasured
factors, which can lead to differences in outcome. For this reason, models that allow for
heterogeneity are recommended (DerSimonian & Laird, 1986; van Houwelingen et al.
2002). We fitted models that assumed a fixed
effect (equal across studies) of measurable covariates, such as gender or age group, on
ADHD prevalence and a random effect for study that allowed for the same types of subjects
(e.g. male adult with a diagnostic interview and current diagnoses design) to have
different prevalence in different studies, and also provided for a mechanism to allow
prevalence correlation in the same study strata (intra-cluster correlation).

In recent years, a high prevalence of psychopathology (depression, psychotic illness,
ADHD, conduct disorder) has been recognized in prison inmates (Fazel et al.
2008a, 
b
; Bradley, 2009), and although more
comprehensive mental health screens are being developed for use at prison reception to
develop effective care strategies (Senior et al.
2012), a possible explanation for the results of
the meta-analysis may be that there is a high rate of false positives identified by ADHD
screens in youths/adults compared with the diagnostic interview-only subset. Retrospective
screening and interview accounts of childhood symptoms given by adult inmates were
estimated to be significantly higher than those given by a current diagnoses cohort (36.4%
v. 21.7%). It seems important that all inmates are considered for
mental health screening, including ADHD, and those with positive screens be referred for a
clinical assessment. What is unknown, however, is the rate of false-negative screens in
this population.

The predominantly reported analysis used prevalence obtained only from diagnostic
clinical interview data. This is also consistent with the diagnosis of ADHD in the
community and enables a fairer comparison when comparing rates with the general
population.

Consistent with prevalence and patterns of remission in the general population (Polanczyk
et al.
2007; Young & Gudjonsson, 2008; Simon et al.
2009), we would expect adult prevalence to have
been lower than youth prevalence; yet when applying a diagnostic interview (model 2),
these were very similar (26.2% v. 30.1%). It has been reported that the
onset of offending is at a younger age for youth with ADHD, even as young as 10 years of
age (Langley et al.
2010; Young et al.
2010b), and perhaps these young
offenders are less likely to be given a custodial sentence and/or are diverted out of the
criminal justice system (e.g. to residential homes as ‘at-risk’ youths). However, an
arbitrary classification was determined in the current review to stratify youth and adult
offenders (i.e. if the mean/median age was above 18 years, a study was classified as an
‘adult study’). This might have led to some youth diagnoses being included as an adult
diagnosis, and possibly skewed the data.
Geographical differences

Large differences were reported between countries. However, when grouped into three
regions (North America, Europe and Other countries), these differences were not
significant. Europe had the highest estimated rate, followed by North America and then
Other countries. These variations may be due partly to study sample sizes: 70% (seven of
10) of the diagnostic interview studies carried out in North America had sample sizes
>200, compared with only 22% (two of nine) of European studies. The North American
prevalence (26.9%) is closer to the prevalence obtained overall (by diagnostic interview)
for offenders with youth and adult ADHD (30.1% and 26.2%, respectively). Hence, these
larger samples may give an accurate estimate of prevalence.

The differential may also reflect differences in the North American and European criminal
justice systems. Following the introduction of tougher laws and penalties surrounding drug
crimes by the US government, the number of inmates convicted of a drug crime rose by 1300%
in the USA between 1980 and 2001 (Jensen et al.
2004). This compares with only 12% of a Scottish
prison population incarcerated for drug-related crimes (Young et al.
2010b). Nevertheless, just under
half of this Scottish sample self-reported drug dependence, and hierarchical multiple
regressions indicated that previous drug use was the most powerful predictor of the total
extent of offending, whereas a history of ADHD symptoms was the most powerful predictor of
violent crimes. Thus, US prison populations may have an over-representation of those who
have been incarcerated for drug crimes, which may not necessarily be related to ‘reactive,
impulsive offences' (e.g. robbery and property crimes) thought to be associated with ADHD
(Retz & Rosler, 2009).
Gender differences

Female adults (with diagnostic interview) had the lowest predicted ADHD prevalence when
comparing by age and gender (22.1% v. 31.2%, male adults). However,
female youths had similar prevalence to male youths (30.8% and 29.5%, respectively). The
general population prevalence indicates a 4:1 ratio of boys to girls with ADHD (Cuffe
et al.
2005), yet in the prison population this ratio
seems much reduced. Hence, the protective mechanisms that may usually keep females out of
prison (e.g. sentencing policies, family considerations) seem to be overridden for female
offenders with ADHD. However, only a few data sets reporting on female prevalence were
included in the ‘diagnostic interview’ analysis (n = 8) compared with
male prevalence (n = 22), which may have given a restricted
representation of the position. A recent study from Konstenius et al.
(2012) sampled 56 adult incarcerated women who
were assessed by diagnostic interview in a Swedish prison, and reported that 29% met
DSM-IV criteria for ADHD. This study, not identified during our initial literature search,
supports a similar ADHD prevalence in female adults to this meta-analysis. In the present
review, male adult diagnostic interview data are the most reliable because of the quantity
and hence high power available: 14752 male youth interview subjects and 1978 male adult
interview subjects compared with 2623 female youth and 222 female adult subjects.

The prevalence rate of males to females in adults with ADHD (~1.5:1) is much lower than
the observed ratio of 4:1 in youths with ADHD (Montejano et al.
2011; Willcutt, 2012; McCarthy et al.
2012). Male adults diagnosed by clinical
interview showed a similar prevalence to youths (31.2% v. 30.8% female or
29.5% male). This suggests that incarcerated youths may remain in the criminal justice
system because of repeat offending. Analysis of data from the Swedish National Register
found that 36.6% males with ADHD were convicted of crime compared with 15.4% of females.
Importantly, it was found that the use of ADHD medication reduced the risk of criminality
among probands with ADHD: by 32% in men and 41% in women (Lichtenstein et al.
2012).
Limitations

Two important caveats to this review should be noted. First, publication bias is always
an issue in systematic reviews, but efforts to address this were made in several ways.
Data were obtained from all available sources, including those from electronic databases
and authors, and review papers were checked (post-2006). Bias in study selection was
addressed by delivering training on how to extract data from a random sample of
publications, and each researcher checked and independently reviewed a random sample of
each others’ papers for data interpretation consistency. Second, factors such as the
reliability of ADHD diagnoses and differences in the criminal justice system between and
within countries could have contributed to the broad ranges of prevalence observed in this
review. The heterogeneity of samples used is also a potential source of variability and
was the reason for using a fitted model that assumed a fixed effect (equal across studies)
of measurable covariates but random study effects in the meta-analysis. In addition, only
those publications since 1980 and in English were included.

Conclusions

Overall, the estimated prevalence of ADHD in incarcerated populations is 25.5% based on
diagnostic clinical interviews. The ADHD prevalence was estimated to be significantly lower
in studies with current diagnoses compared with retrospective diagnoses. There was a large
variation in ADHD prevalence between countries, but this was no longer evident when grouped
regionally. This systematic review and meta-analysis found, on average, a fivefold increased
prevalence of ADHD in youth prison populations (30.1%) and a 10-fold increase in adult
prison populations (26.2%) compared with published general population prevalence (3–7% and
1–5%, respectively). Female adults had a lower prevalence of ADHD, when compared by age and
gender, than male adults. However, the risk for females was almost as high as that for
males.

2007; Willcutt, 2012) and 1–5% of adults (Asherson, 2004;
Asherson et al.
2005, 2012;
Kessler et al.
2006; Simon et al.
2009; Willcutt, 2012).

There is no generally accepted estimate of the prevalence of ADHD in incarcerated
populations; research studies have consistently reported a disproportionately higher rate of
individuals with ADHD in the criminal justice system compared with general population
prevalence. These individuals, who are often untreated, seem to have greater judicial
contact and pose higher risk within the criminal justice system. Compared with other
offenders, they present with younger age at first contact, greater recidivism and
institutional behaviour disturbance (Young et al.
2003, 2009b, 2011). A Scottish prison study found that inmates with
ADHD symptoms were involved in up to eight times more institutional aggression; this strong
association was maintained even when controlling for antisocial personality characteristics,
with aggressive incidents being six times greater compared with non-ADHD peers (Young
et al.
2009b). These problems are likely
to be associated with underlying deficits in executive dysfunction (Young et al.
2007; Bramham et al.
2009; Rose et al.
2009); in particular, behavioural disinhibition and
emotional dysregulation (Gudjonsson et al.
2009, 2012).

However, prevalence varies widely among studies and methodologies differ. Hence, this study
reviewed the data obtained from a systematic literature search performed to ascertain the
lifetime/current prevalence of ADHD in prison populations in both youths and adults. The
study aimed to specify (1) the prevalence of ADHD in incarcerated youth and adult offenders,
including differences by gender; (2) prevalence from studies applying screening tools and
diagnostic clinical interviews; (3) differences in prevalence obtained from retrospective
diagnoses from adults and youth prevalence obtained using a current diagnoses methodology;
and (4) geographical differences.

The systematic review was performed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA; Liberati et al.
2009) guidelines. Initial searches were carried
out in a variety of databases and websites to gain an understanding of the amount of
information available. Reports published since 1980 and in English were included.

Searches were conducted in OvidSP Medline (1948 to present) and EMBASE (1988 to present
segment), Datastar PsycINFO (unrestricted) and Social SciSearch (1972 to date; limited to
English and added since 1 January 1980), including the literature published between 1
January 1980 and 3 May 2011; a citations update was performed on 21 June 2011 and extended
to 31 August 2012 in October 2012.

Search terms were developed, refined and tested for relevance by cross-checking results
against a list of known relevant articles provided by the lead author. The following
descriptors were used in OvidSP EMBASE (1988 to present segment): ADHD; attention deficit
disorder; [EMTREE] crime; criminals; criminology; criminal behaviour; criminal justice;
criminal law; court; criminal psychology; delinquency; juvenile delinquency; gang; legal
evidence; legal procedure; police; legal liability; mandatory programs; violence; prisons;
prisoner; probation; law enforcement; recidivism; jurisprudence; punishment; offender;
drug abuse; drug misuse.

Articles obtained from the final searches were first de-duplicated, then an
inclusion/exclusion process was undertaken based on the following exclusion criteria:
non-English language articles, articles published before 1980, animal studies, articles
that were not peer reviewed (e.g. theses), and articles that obviously did not hold
relevance (e.g. they did not focus on ADHD or crime, or they focused on substance misuse
but not from the criminology perspective). Review articles pre-2006 were excluded, and
post-2006 reviews were kept with the sole purpose to examine bibliographies to check for
any other articles not identified in the search; these review articles were not included
in the final prevalence calculation; only primary research articles were included.
Articles with no abstract (including initial PsycINFO and Social SciSearch search outputs)
were also excluded unless the title or other information (e.g. key terms) suggested they
may hold relevance. The inclusion/exclusion review was first completed based on
title/abstract/key words by four researchers, and if the relevance of an article was
unclear, the full text was retrieved before a final decision was made. Once the initial
bulk of the inclusion/exclusion process was completed, abstracts were reviewed
independently by the lead author before full-text articles were retrieved. Any
uncertainties over including/excluding articles were discussed among the researchers and a
final decision was made once the full-text articles were reviewed.

The full texts of included articles were retrieved for detailed evaluation against
eligibility criteria. Only the publications that focused on incarcerated/prison
populations and those that reported ADHD prevalence were selected. Studies that reported
results on mixed gender populations were excluded as we aimed to separate the gender
effect in modelling.

A data extraction sheet was developed in Microsoft Excel and pilot tested on 13 randomly
selected studies and refined accordingly. The publications were divided among four
researchers (including two authors: D.M. and O.S.) who performed the data extraction
independently. Data were reviewed for consistency and any queries were resolved by
discussion among the researchers and the lead author. The lead author also made the final
decision whether to include/exclude data by reviewing the identified publications.

The authors of 11 studies were contacted directly in personal communications to ascertain
missing information relating to age of the study population (Black et al.
2004; Sanz-Garcia et al.
2010a, 
b
), gender (Vitelli, 1996), method of
assessment of ADHD (Gordon & Moore, 2005), study population (Cahill et al.
2012; Colins et al.
2012) and verification of the incarcerated status
of the sample (Langevin, 2003; Rosler et
al.
2009; Retz & Rosler, 2010; Lindsay et al.
2012). All responded with additional information
that had not been included in the original publication and, if meeting inclusion criteria,
was included in this meta-analysis (indicated in Supplementary Tables S1 and S2).

Some cohorts of prison populations were published more than once. To avoid double
counting data, multiple reports of the same cohort were pieced together by juxtaposing
author names, treatment comparisons, sample sizes and outcomes. An exception to this rule
occurred in relation to the Young et al. (2010a, 2011) reports; whereas Young et al. (2010a) used diagnostic interviews, Young et
al. (2011) used screening data to
provide ADHD prevalence. In the interest of obtaining meaningful data on diagnostic
differences in ADHD, these reports were considered as separate studies. In addition,
following author communication, more recent data from Cahill et al.
(2012) were included rather than data from an
earlier publication of the same population (Coolidge et al.
2009).

For each included study, data were extracted into a data set containing: (1) study
location (country of origin), (2) study sample size, (3) study population (including age
and gender), (4) diagnostic criteria (screening or diagnostic interview), (5) study design
(retrospective, that is adult studies reporting a prevalence of childhood ADHD, or current
diagnoses), (6) ADHD prevalence and (7) treatment (including prison management). We have
used the term ‘prison’ but included all individuals who were incarcerated, jailed or
imprisoned, or similar descriptors. For the analysis, studies were grouped by age for
youth and adult offenders (see Supplementary Tables S1 and S2). It was noted that there
was no clear definition across publications on the age of an adult versus
a youth. For the purposes of this meta-analysis, we designated 18 years to be the cut-off
point for a youth becoming an adult (i.e. youths were ⩽18 years and adults were >18
years); papers reporting youth data often cited 18 years as the upper limit of the age
range of participants. In those papers where an age range was given that spanned this
cut-off point (e.g. 15–28 years), the mean (or median if mean was not provided) was used
to define whether the study population should be listed as ‘youth’ or ‘adult’. For studies
reporting on (1) both genders separately, (2) both diagnostic criteria or (3) both study
designs, information was recorded as two separate observations (‘study strata’) linked by
the study number. None of the studies reported separate results on more than one of these
three characteristics and none reported on both age groups.

For a diagnosis of ADHD to be given in adulthood, clinically significant symptoms must
have been present in childhood. Therefore, when assessing adults for ADHD, it is necessary
to establish whether they meet criteria for childhood ADHD, requiring them to
retrospectively report on their symptoms (if a diagnosis did not already exist). Some
adult studies (n = 13) included in this meta-analysis also reported a
prevalence of childhood ADHD for the cohort (referred to as a retrospective diagnosis in
this study).

To ascertain the validity of eligible publications, each researcher checked and
independently reviewed a random sample of each others' papers for data extraction and
interpretation consistency. Disagreements were resolved by reviewing the data source and
by discussion between the three reviewers (one of whom is an author).

Summary prevalence estimates were calculated for the meta-analysis. Observed prevalence
per study stratum was reported by age and gender groups. Model-predicted prevalence was
reported by the various model covariates together with their corresponding 95% confidence
intervals (CIs).

A mixed log-binomial model was fitted for the observed prevalence in the study strata to
estimate the significance of the various risk factors (model 1). Covariates collected for
predicting ADHD prevalence included gender, age group, diagnostic method, study design and
country. The model included fixed effects for each of the covariates and a random study
effect, and can be defined as follows: 

 where yij is the number of patients with the response, pij is the ADHD prevalence and nij is the total number of inmates included in study i and on stratum
j. As implemented here, the model made the following assumptions: 

Given the observed level of interaction between gender, age group and diagnostic
method, these three covariates were fully interacted in the model and were represented by
eight indicator variables (one omitted as a reference group). Other interactions were also
tested for significance. Marginal estimates of prevalence (least-square means) for each of
the covariates (e.g. males, adults, etc.) and for their combinations were calculated by
applying the inverse logarithmic transformation to model predictors. To estimate the
sensitivity of results to the diagnostic method, the model was refitted to a subset of
data using diagnostic interview strata only (model 2). For the sensitivity analysis model
(model 2), the aforementioned eight indicator variables for the interaction of gender, age
group and diagnostic method were collapsed to four to capture the interaction of
age-by-gender group.

The models were fitted adopting a frequentist estimation approach using PROC GLIMMIX in
SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute, USA).

In total, 8520 publications were identified following the OvidSP Medline, EMBASE, Datastar,
PsycINFO and Social SciSearch database search. Publications not specifically relating to
ADHD and criminality and duplicates between databases were excluded electronically, leaving
325. Once further duplicates had been identified manually, 311 publications remained. A
further 218 publications were excluded after further review as they did not report on
samples composed entirely of incarcerated/prison populations. Of the 93 articles remaining,
a further 40 articles were excluded as they did not provide prevalence data on ADHD; 53
publications included ADHD prevalence data. Three studies (Young et al.
2009a; Ginsberg &
Lindefors, 2012; Tidefors & Strand, 2012) were excluded as they used samples composed
solely of participants who had ADHD, hence giving a prevalence rate of 100%. A further eight
studies were excluded as they only provided mixed-gender prevalence (Milin et al.
1991; Fulwiler et al.
1997; Rasmussen et al.
2000, 2001; Black et al.
2004, 2010;
Anckarsater et al.
2007; Einat & Einat, 2008; Gudjonsson et al.
2009), leaving 42 studies included in the
meta-analysis, reporting prevalence by gender (Fig.
1).

an interview diagnosis (21 studies, 30 study strata) was 20.5% (total number of inmates
was 19575, of whom 4008 were reported to be diagnosed with ADHD).

Studies report the variable prevalence of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
(ADHD) in incarcerated populations. The aim of this meta-analysis was to determine the
prevalence of ADHD in these populations.

Primary research studies reporting the prevalence (lifetime/current) of ADHD in
incarcerated populations were identified. The meta-analysis used a mixed log-binomial
model, including fixed effects for each covariate and a random study effect, to estimate
the significance of various risk factors.

Forty-two studies were included in the analysis. ADHD prevalence was higher with
screening diagnoses versus diagnostic interview (and with retrospective
youth diagnoses versus current diagnoses). Using diagnostic interview
data, the estimated prevalence was 25.5% and there were no significant differences for
gender and age. Significant country differences were noted.

Compared with published general population prevalence, there is a fivefold increase in
prevalence of ADHD in youth prison populations (30.1%) and a 10-fold increase in adult
prison populations (26.2%).

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is defined in DSM-IV (APA, 1994) and ICD-10 (WHO, 1992) as high levels of hyperactive, impulsive and/or inattentive behaviours
beginning in early childhood. A level of impairment in at least two areas of life needs to
be evident for at least 6 months' duration for a diagnosis of ADHD to be made. ADHD is a
common disorder that often persists into adulthood (Faraone et al.
2006), affecting 3–7% of youths (Asherson, 2004; Asherson et al.
2005; Polanczyk et al.
2007; Willcutt, 2012) and 1–5% of adults (Asherson, 2004;
Asherson et al.
2005, 2012;
Kessler et al.
2006; Simon et al.
2009; Willcutt, 2012).

There is no generally accepted estimate of the prevalence of ADHD in incarcerated
populations; research studies have consistently reported a disproportionately higher rate of
individuals with ADHD in the criminal justice system compared with general population
prevalence. These individuals, who are often untreated, seem to have greater judicial
contact and pose higher risk within the criminal justice system. Compared with other
offenders, they present with younger age at first contact, greater recidivism and
institutional behaviour disturbance (Young et al.
2003, 2009b, 2011). A Scottish prison study found that inmates with
ADHD symptoms were involved in up to eight times more institutional aggression; this strong
association was maintained even when controlling for antisocial personality characteristics,
with aggressive incidents being six times greater compared with non-ADHD peers (Young
et al.
2009b). These problems are likely
to be associated with underlying deficits in executive dysfunction (Young et al.
2007; Bramham et al.
2009; Rose et al.
2009); in particular, behavioural disinhibition and
emotional dysregulation (Gudjonsson et al.
2009, 2012).

However, prevalence varies widely among studies and methodologies differ. Hence, this study
reviewed the data obtained from a systematic literature search performed to ascertain the
lifetime/current prevalence of ADHD in prison populations in both youths and adults. The
study aimed to specify (1) the prevalence of ADHD in incarcerated youth and adult offenders,
including differences by gender; (2) prevalence from studies applying screening tools and
diagnostic clinical interviews; (3) differences in prevalence obtained from retrospective
diagnoses from adults and youth prevalence obtained using a current diagnoses methodology;
and (4) geographical differences.

The systematic review was performed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA; Liberati et al.
2009) guidelines. Initial searches were carried
out in a variety of databases and websites to gain an understanding of the amount of
information available. Reports published since 1980 and in English were included.

Searches were conducted in OvidSP Medline (1948 to present) and EMBASE (1988 to present
segment), Datastar PsycINFO (unrestricted) and Social SciSearch (1972 to date; limited to
English and added since 1 January 1980), including the literature published between 1
January 1980 and 3 May 2011; a citations update was performed on 21 June 2011 and extended
to 31 August 2012 in October 2012.

Search terms were developed, refined and tested for relevance by cross-checking results
against a list of known relevant articles provided by the lead author. The following
descriptors were used in OvidSP EMBASE (1988 to present segment): ADHD; attention deficit
disorder; [EMTREE] crime; criminals; criminology; criminal behaviour; criminal justice;
criminal law; court; criminal psychology; delinquency; juvenile delinquency; gang; legal
evidence; legal procedure; police; legal liability; mandatory programs; violence; prisons;
prisoner; probation; law enforcement; recidivism; jurisprudence; punishment; offender;
drug abuse; drug misuse.

Articles obtained from the final searches were first de-duplicated, then an
inclusion/exclusion process was undertaken based on the following exclusion criteria:
non-English language articles, articles published before 1980, animal studies, articles
that were not peer reviewed (e.g. theses), and articles that obviously did not hold
relevance (e.g. they did not focus on ADHD or crime, or they focused on substance misuse
but not from the criminology perspective). Review articles pre-2006 were excluded, and
post-2006 reviews were kept with the sole purpose to examine bibliographies to check for
any other articles not identified in the search; these review articles were not included
in the final prevalence calculation; only primary research articles were included.
Articles with no abstract (including initial PsycINFO and Social SciSearch search outputs)
were also excluded unless the title or other information (e.g. key terms) suggested they
may hold relevance. The inclusion/exclusion review was first completed based on
title/abstract/key words by four researchers, and if the relevance of an article was
unclear, the full text was retrieved before a final decision was made. Once the initial
bulk of the inclusion/exclusion process was completed, abstracts were reviewed
independently by the lead author before full-text articles were retrieved. Any
uncertainties over including/excluding articles were discussed among the researchers and a
final decision was made once the full-text articles were reviewed.

The full texts of included articles were retrieved for detailed evaluation against
eligibility criteria. Only the publications that focused on incarcerated/prison
populations and those that reported ADHD prevalence were selected. Studies that reported
results on mixed gender populations were excluded as we aimed to separate the gender
effect in modelling.

A data extraction sheet was developed in Microsoft Excel and pilot tested on 13 randomly

decision whether to include/exclude data by reviewing the identified publications.

The authors of 11 studies were contacted directly in personal communications to ascertain
missing information relating to age of the study population (Black et al.
2004; Sanz-Garcia et al.
2010a,

), gender (Vitelli, 1996), method of
assessment of ADHD (Gordon & Moore, 2005), study population (Cahill et al.

of the sample (Langevin, 2003; Rosler et

2009; Retz & Rosler, 2010; Lindsay et al.
2012). All responded with additional information
that had not been included in the original publication and, if meeting inclusion criteria,

Some cohorts of prison populations were published more than once. To avoid double

differences in ADHD, these reports were considered as separate studies. In addition,
following author communication, more recent data from Cahill et al.
(2012) were included rather than data from an
earlier publication of the same population (Coolidge et al.
2009).

For each included study, data were extracted into a data set containing: (1) study
location (country of origin), (2) study sample size, (3) study population (including age
and gender), (4) diagnostic criteria (screening or diagnostic interview), (5) study design

For a diagnosis of ADHD to be given in adulthood, clinically significant symptoms must
have been present in childhood. Therefore, when assessing adults for ADHD, it is necessary
to establish whether they meet criteria for childhood ADHD, requiring them to
retrospectively report on their symptoms (if a diagnosis did not already exist). Some
adult studies (n = 13) included in this meta-analysis also reported a
